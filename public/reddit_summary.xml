      <title>Please Help - Decision between TC500 and TR500 Speed Queen Washer</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1mc0oo2/please_help_decision_between_tc500_and_tr500/</link>
      <description>Basically the title. I‚Äôm going insane trying to decide what‚Äôs best. It doesn‚Äôt help that I‚Äôm the most indecisive person ever. We‚Äôve been without a fully functioning washer for more than a week and it‚Äôs not sustainable. 

Everyone on Reddit seems to have varying opinions on these models with no real consensus. Both sides have valid concerns and both sides have loyalists. I just want something for my family that washes well, doesn‚Äôt destroy clothes, and will last a long time. Also, I cannot figure out the difference between the TR500 and 700. 

With the TC I see the beauty of its simplicity and lack of lid lock (the bane of my existence on our Maytag that came with the house and balancing) and the features of the TR, so I truly feel stuck. 

I‚Äôm also wondering about Speed Queen front loaders now but I know top loaders are traditionally more reliable. I‚Äôll be getting a matching dryer because wife lol so I hope their dryers are as good. 

I‚Äôm not sure if anyone can really help me because I‚Äôm looking for a unicorn person who has owned both but seeing as they last a long time, maybe they don‚Äôt exist and that‚Äôs a good thing! 

Sorry for the dissertation‚Äîany help or advice would be greatly appreciated. 

Thank you! üòä</description>

      <title>Light weight Olukai sandals</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1mc67d2/light_weight_olukai_sandals/</link>
      <description>To all Olukai maxis out there. I really like the quality of this brand but i struggle to find something that is somehow comparable to a regular rubber flip flop in terms of weight. I've tried Ohana and Ulele and both are too heavy for my taste, it doesn't feel comfortable to walk in them. Unfortunately, I don't have an affiliated store close to me to visit and try all kind of versions.

Do you have any suggestions for a more light weight product of this brand?</description>

      <title>Men‚Äôs fashion brands</title>
      <link>https://i.redd.it/xx906uvh2sff1.jpeg</link>
      <description>Hi

I would like a more sustainable wardrobe and get real quality that lasts forever. What I typically wear is jeans with sneakers and t shirts or shirts. Relaxed dad with a ‚Äú2007 hipster twist‚Äù, so flannel shirts, rugged overshirts in toned down colors, for example. I like the look of being well dressed without posh. Brands I could wear would be Patagonia, Levi‚Äôs, Lee, Carhartt , Clark‚Äôs, new balance.

Any recommendations for brands that are lasting long time and would likely fit my style ?
The picture could be an example of my style.

Thanks !!</description>

      <title>Are expensive phone cases actually worth it? Or is a cheap one just as good?</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1mc1r58/are_expensive_phone_cases_actually_worth_it_or_is/</link>
      <description>So I wanna get a new phone case that looks good. I was browsing on Amazon today and noticed the prices are¬†*wild*¬†‚Äì some are like a few bucks, others are like $50! I never really paid much attention to case prices before; I usually just bought whatever looked cute. So, what's the deal? Are the expensive ones genuinely better, or are they basically all the same? Maybe the pricier ones use higher quality materials? Anyone actually tested this? Should I just shell out for the expensive one?</description>

      <title>Recommendations for 10-15k daily steps walking shoes?</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1mbz6ko/recommendations_for_1015k_daily_steps_walking/</link>
      <description>I started a job recently training service dogs, and we walk about 10-15k steps per day. The company gives us a $100 stipend to buy walking shoes. I‚Äôm normally just in Chucks day-to-day but I‚Äôm interested in buying something that isn‚Äôt just going to get worn out and thrown away. I have flat feet from a foot surgery, and most ‚Äúwalking shoes‚Äù have so much excessive arch support it kills me. I want something with cushion, or that will mold to my feet, but with low arches. I‚Äôm looking into RedWing Chelseas maybe? I like that they slip on because we have to change shoes during the day and I don‚Äôt want to mess with a ton of laces. I just don‚Äôt know if the kinds of shoes I‚Äôm looking at are good for lots of daily urban walking. Anyone have any recommendations please?</description>

      <title>Eink Mp3 Player + Calender/Reminders?</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1mbdpmk/eink_mp3_player_calenderreminders/</link>
      <description>Hi all,

I've been considering switching to an Eink phone for a while, but think I've whittled down what I actually need, and it isn't a phone.

I'm wondering what my best options are for an eink device that I can use primarily as an MP3 player and for calendar/reminders? 

I know things like the Boox Palma and the Hisense A9 exist, but they're a bit pricey (I had the Hisense A9 running LineageOS but found it very large and heavy so sold it).  
I'm open to a Mudita Kompakt if I can get one at a good price and just not put a sim card into it.

Maybe those 3 are the best available options, but if there are others I'd love to know.

Thanks!</description>

      <title>e-ink vs iPad for building a second brain, in searchable text form</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1mbmwiz/eink_vs_ipad_for_building_a_second_brain_in/</link>
      <description>So I'm currently looking to set up a knowledge base or the much mentioned "second brain" some people have. I'm a bit torn between going for an iPad and an e-ink tablet. Current thinking is the Supernote Manta looks like the most likely option for what I need, with the organisation features.

So the main pros of a digital device in general is the ability to store, tag and search documents and ideas for the long haul. I have considered using something like Obsidian to bring all my various notepads together. However I work (like many people) on a screen all day and as such I feel that I get enough screentime as it is.

I have so many notebooks strewn across the place, and the one thing I basically never do is convert them into some sort of indexable, useful knowledge. So the idea of either an app or a device that would help pull this all together and organise is very appealing. I also have temporary notes such as daytime checklists for work that could work well digitised.

iPad would give me the ability to take notes, and as a bonus do things like email, or even digital art or other fun hobby stuff. I'd feel confident enough to create focus modes for when the need to note strikes. The other plus for the iPad is that if the note-taking habit doesn't stick, the device has other utilities. But that feeling of yet another glass screen is the main thing holding me back. While those extra bells and whistles would be fun, the main outcome of getting the tablet would be using it around the house and on the desk for writing, organising and going back through old notes.

For around 2/3 the cost (Supernote has a hefty import tax to the UK, but it's still cheaper than a well-specced iPad and Apple Pencil Pro) Supernote has a simplified workflow and focussed approach. I like the idea of just doodling on this after hours, so I can break off from the blue light and have notes on a device that is digitised, but avoids the trappings of the screen. I recognise that e-ink isn't perfect from owning a Kindle a while back, and I know there's some debate about the varying quality of the writing experience.

Is this a clear cut case for the e-ink device, or have I missed something here? Has anyone had to pick between these and chosen one way or the other for building a knowledge base of all their old notes? Interested to hear from anyone who has run these devices longer term and has some reflections on their choice.</description>

      <description>Users are unable to make new posts on the Mobiscribe subreddit. Whatever the reason for that, there's still no doubt some users around like myself who now or at some point will have things they'd like to discuss regarding their devices.

&amp;nbsp;

I figured I'd make a general thread here that might show up when people are googling "mobiscribe (problem) reddit" or whatever. 

&amp;nbsp;

I have a new B&amp;W Wave. So far enjoying it a lot, incredible value at $99. One issue I'm having is passive battery drain is a little more than I'd like, if any users have any advice on that, maybe there's some software tweaks?</description>

      <title>Bigme HiBreak Pro permission controller app keeps crashing after update - anyone else?</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1mbnf6u/bigme_hibreak_pro_permission_controller_app_keeps/</link>
      <description>The permission controller app on my Bigme Hibreak Pro crashes on every boot, reboot and several times throughout the day, usually when I'm changing permissions for apps (camera use, location use, accessibility use, etc.). AV app and autofill app (Bitwarden) need accessibility privileges and it keeps messing with those every crash. I'm running Android 14 and This only started after a major system update (2.4.2) &amp; consequent smaller security one (200-300MB). I have been using CCleaner to optimize apps/system and have disabled/frozen a few I'll never use (not Android system or Google services apps). Phone is not rooted. Anyone else having this issue?

      <description>I've been looking for a comparison of the various nibs for EMR pens. My question was regarding Wacom EMR nibs. I really never found a chart, so I asked ChatGPT, and it generated this chart. (You may have to click the post to see the chart). In your opinion, is the chart accurate?

|Nib Type|Friction|Durability|Feel (vs. paper)|Sound|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Standard POM|Low|High|Slippery|Clicky|
|Felt|High|Low|Most paper-like|Quiet|
|Rubber/Elastomer|Medium|Medium|Balanced|Quiet|

      <title>3-Color Eink panels CAN update quickly</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1mbedbh/3color_eink_panels_can_update_quickly/</link>
      <description>I've been researching the inner workings of Eink panels for the last year or so and have created various libraries to drive them (bb\_epaper and FastEPD). For the last week I've been creating custom LUTs (look up tables) for the UltraChip UC81xx controller to bring new functionality to 1-bit (Black/White) displays. I found a Black/White/Red UC81xx panel in my collection so I decided to start experimenting with additional functionality on these panels. Normally 3-color Eink displays take 13-25 seconds to update. In the video you can see a 1.5 second fast black/white mode that I created.

Now I need to figure out how the Solomon Systech SSD16xx LUTs work :)</description>

      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1mbugh9/how_really_is_an_eink_phone/</link>
      <description>Hello, I am a 21yrs old (m) and I am addicted to screen (either phone or laptop) but want to work in cybersecurity. Since people who works in IT field generally spend a lot of time on computer or laptop screen so I think having an e-ink phone or laptop would be better because I heard that they do not emit blue light.
So I was thinking about switching from my actual phone to an e-ink phone, because this community focus on talking about e-ink phone so I would like to know what would be the best recommandation ? The advantages and the downsides of them? Are they expensive ? If yes do they worth buying them?

Thanks for taking your time to read it, any comment is welcome(I am English learner so sorry if you don't understand some part of my text).</description>

      <description>Got bored late at night so I just thought about all the Serbian Siege players rn (Including me) who would, probably, want a SAJ-based Operatorüá∑üá∏
Ubisoft already did "Osa" and she is Croatian, So I see this being possible...??..If the head dev catches on. Me personally I think its not any mind blowing or crazy idea, But it would be heavily appreciated by the Serbian playerbase..Though I could see "him" get loved by the whole world too, Since they dont look ordinary, But I guess..kinda unique?..Ill pop like 1 or 2 pics here just to show what they look like.‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è (Oh also, Im not even sure what could his ability be? But if this EVER gets thought about, Im pretty sure Ubisoft will handle the thinkingüò≠)</description>

      <title>Update 2 hacked account</title>
      <link>https://i.redd.it/g8zuj8du9off1.jpeg</link>
      <description>So, as you can see in my other post, my account has been hacked some time ago. After trying to find a solution with Ubisoft to Noah Phil, I decided to contact them again for like the 60th time. This time threatening with legal action. Meanwhile, I also made a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. Luckily, when I made the legal threat, an actual human being reviewed my case and helped me. I just now also got a message back from the Better Business Bureau and I got a response through there as well. As you can see, I highly recommend everyone that has problems regarding with Ubisoft to do the same thing I did. I really hope this helps anyone out there with any problems that I had as well.</description>
