      <title>BIFL backpack: time to replace my antique</title>
      <link>https://i.redd.it/2lqxa0oj7ggf1.jpeg</link>
      <description>I've got an all leather backpack that is probably 40+ years old and, despite my restoration work is really reaching the limit of its lifespan (can't say I'm surprised when I found it it in someone's backyard 25 years ago).

Ramble aside, I'm trying to find a BIFL backpack of the same caliber. So far my early brand that I'm looking at is Time Resistance just because it *feels* close to this old beast in terms of style, selection of leather used, etc.

Anyone have any quality suggestions? Picture of the old workhorse submitted for algorithm enhancement.</description>

      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1mf9i5u/looking_for_relatively_basic_mp3_player/</link>
      <description>That's pretty much it. I use Spotify but want to disconnect and delete my account. I have tons and tons of music on external hard drives that I want to put on an mp3 player. I don't want a lot of bells and whistles, just large storage (or large sd card capability), no apps, I'd be ok if it had radio and connect wirelessly to a Bluetooth headset, but neither isn't a deal breaker. I was looking at the Sony NW A307 (the Japan one) and the HiBy R4 but I know there are so many more out there.</description>

      <title>Looking for a stick vacuum like the one in the photo trusted models you’ve used for years?</title>
      <link>https://i.redd.it/r4s3ie2z7ggf1.jpeg</link>
      <description>Hi everyone!
I’m based in Canada and looking for a durable and well-tested vacuum cleaner around 250 CAD.
However, if there’s a clearly better option that’s more expensive, I’m open to suggestions!
I really like the idea of stick vacuums, like the Electrolux Ergorapido Pet 2-in-1. Here’s what I’m looking for:

	•	Compact, no bulky hoses preferably a stick vacuum form factor

	•	Capable of cleaning low-pile carpets, especially when there are crumbs and food bits

	•	I currently live in a small room, but might move into a larger space 

	•	Corded or cordless — doesn’t matter, as long as it’s reliable and practical

	•	Not interested in big vacuums that take up lots of space or have long hoses that tangle themselves

I’d really appreciate genuine recommendations please share a model you’ve personally used for several years, that still runs well, hasn’t clogged or died after a year, and is still available for purchase.

Thanks in advance! 🙏</description>

      <title>Any downside to getting the Dasung 13k B+W model WITH frontlight, even if I don't intend to use the function?</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1meyi3e/any_downside_to_getting_the_dasung_13k_bw_model/</link>
      <description>Hey guys,

This might be a dumb question but I can't seem to see it anywhere laid out specifically so I'll just ask:

I'm intending to use the Dasung 13K B+W with the frontlight DISABLED.. but I figure it's probably worth having the OPTION to turn it on at some point in case I really need it.. as long as having it doesn't cause any problems/quality loss when it's OFF. 

In other words, if I turn the frontlight off, is my model identical in quality/sharpness etc to the NON frontlight model?

Thanks for thoughts! Just about to order this and can't wait to not stare at glowing pixels.. but wanted to check this last thing before I hit buy.</description>

      <title>Review: Colour eInk not (yet) for me, loving the Kobo Clara BW!</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1mfi3yf/review_colour_eink_not_yet_for_me_loving_the_kobo/</link>
      <description>Cross-posting here and r/kobo,, might also post on some vendor sites as review (Rakuten Kobo, Amazon)

My 10-year-old Kindle Paperwhite has been dying a slow death. The battery drains quickly, and hard resets are needed more and more often.

As a die-hard fan of eInk technology (I also own a BOOX Note Air 2 Plus), I rely almost exclusively on eReaders for leisure reading. It was time for a new device, and a great time to finally step out of the Amazon ecosystem. Kobo offered the most economical alternative.

Curious about color eInk, I initially ordered the Kobo Libra Colour. But I immediately realized it wasn’t for me. The biggest appeal of eInk, at least for me, is its compatibility with ambient light—it doesn’t feel like a screen. That’s the non-negotiable feature. The backlight is useful, especially when I’m reading to fall asleep (I do keep the light on in that case), but that’s a secondary use. When I’m reading during the day—or anytime I'm not reading in bed—the ability to read with just ambient light and no backlight is essential. It’s what gives eInk its uniquely paper-like feel. The Libra Colour’s screen was simply too dim in ambient light, which is understandable given the current limitations of color eInk. I’m optimistic about future developments, but for now, the low contrast was a dealbreaker and I returned the KLC.

I then ordered the Kobo Clara BW, and it’s perfect—exactly what I needed. Still exploring features, but a few small details already make it far superior to my old Kindle Paperwhite:

* Power button is on the back instead of the bottom
* Brightness adjustment via simply swiping up and down on the screen
* A larger, more customizable font selection

I also picked up a remote page-turn clicker, which has been a surprisingly delightful upgrade to the reading experience.</description>

      <title>Educator at SerD seeks magic tablet (Boox Note Max? Other?) to save patients, students and cervical pain. Advice?</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1mflz2i/educator_at_serd_seeks_magic_tablet_boox_note_max/</link>
      <description>Hello Reddit!
I am a professional educator in an Addiction Service (SerD), with a life divided between:

Educational interviews and rehabilitation activities (individual and group)

Clinical and team meetings

Coordination and tutoring of university students on internship


In the office I have a fixed PC for the back office, but I'm looking for a portable device that will become my new infinite digital notepad, to use on the move for everything else.


---

🎯 What I need to work at SerD:

Read and write on A4 PDF (worksheets, diaries, reports, evaluation tools)

Make quick notes with a pen during educational conversations

Use CBT/DBT-inspired worksheets for activities on emotional regulation and addiction management

Complete the MATE digitally in the first interviews, possibly electronically

If possible, share your screen with a projector or exercise TV during groups

Sync everything with Google Drive (no OneDrive for me, thanks 😅)



---

🎓 For monitoring trainees:

Write down impressions and notes during individual supervisions

Read journals and reflection sheets uploaded to Microsoft Teams

Keep track of training paths (without drowning in flying sheets and folders)



---

🎯 Ideal device requirements:

✅ Preferably A4 format (even if A5 is still in the running, I always carry a backpack)
✅ Excellent pen, fluid and precise writing
✅ Access to Android apps, especially Google Drive, Teams, etc.
✅ Good autonomy, excellent readability in well (or too) lit clinical environments
✅ Quick screen sharing ability for group activities
✅ Budget: within €700, but if it's really worth it I can take the leap of faith


---

🔍 What I spotted:

🖋️ Boox Note Max: it seems perfect for the large screen and Android potential, but I'm looking for real feedback from those who actually use it in similar contexts.
I also evaluate alternatives (Boox Air 4/Go 10.3, Android tablet...) if someone convinces me that it can work better with something else!


---

📣 So I turn to you, digital colleagues:
Educators, therapists, psychologists, teachers, trainers, if you use a device to work without paper and you can no longer do without it, tell me which one.
My back will thank you. And also my document archive.

Thanks in advance! 🙏
(P.S. if the “reminds you to save everything before ending the day” function also existed, it would be perfect 😂)</description>

      <title>Best E-Ink for News Consolidation?</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1mfhd4h/best_eink_for_news_consolidation/</link>
      <description>I am looking to purchase a new E-ink tablet that can allow me to have all of my news/magazine apps (The Economist, Financial Times, Aviation Week, HBR) easily accessible to read. Does anyone have experience using the AI Paper to consolidate their news intake into a single E-Reader? If so, how well did it work for you?

What other e-inks would you recommend for this purpose? I also plan to use the e-ink to read PDFs and take notes, but that’ll be a secondary purpose.

Thanks!</description>

      <title>Hibreak Pro - another point of view review</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1mffapi/hibreak_pro_another_point_of_view_review/</link>
      <description>I've been lurking for sometime, so thought I'd contribute yet another user review of the Hibreak Pro. I'm not a very technical person so it's mostly my experience of using the phone for about a fortnight as my only device, ie not carrying a backup anywhere.

Who is this phone for is a personal question. For some it's eye strain reduction, others trying to escape the doom scroll, others a curiosity. I've tried another eink device - the Boox tab Mini C and found it frustrating, trying to use it as as academic student, but that's another story.

I'm no security buff, but this phone is 2 Android OS generations behind at Android 14, though the security update is from May 2025. What does this mean for security ? I honestly don't know. So I tried leaving behind logging into google services but rather use 3rd party apps ( yes some eye rolling ) to see if that would be a secure work around.

I tried the steps to remove Bigme apps but was not successful, though setting up nextdns is easy enough as I already have an account for it.

# Don't buy this phone if:

\- you are planning to do **on the fly document editing**. With just b&amp;w, it is not for looking at excel sheets, powerpoint etc

\- want to read academic PDFs etc with colour. Word ones are okay since you can reflow them

\- **you think it'll fix your social media etc addiction**. It won't. It might make you watch less NSFW stuff, since definition is important in those situations. Will it stop you from reading online smut ? Nope, eink is perfect for reading. You can still scroll through reddit, the autoload videos look pretty decent on default ink settings.

\- not my area of knowledge, but if you're **worried about security from smaller phone manufacturers from China.**

\- if you **need 2 sims** ! This does not support e-sim, which is a real shame.

You could basically buy a shit lower-mid range phone if your aim is " make me suffer so I don't use my phone" There are many temu android phones for I dunno, 50 bucks etc that can do that, but I don't think thats the way to change you behaviour, it will just frustrate you enough that you'll go back to your old phone.

# What it does well

\- **Display.** That's the main thing right? I have no issues with any text displays. The software optimisation is good enough that on default settings with fast refresh, there is no big lag. Yes there is that "jerk back" when scrolling as it refreshes, but you get used to it quickly

\- **Quick setting buttons**. God sent really, this should be on every phone. One of the main ones is adjusting the light. Basically you can pick a light profile you like, and pressing the button either switches it off, and swaps it to the mode you have on. There are 2 buttons, with option of 1 click, 2 click and long press, so you have 6 assignable options.

\- **battery life**: 2 days going, 50%. checking replying emails, ebook reading for maybe 4 hours. websites browsing through the day ( shame on me )

\- Suprisingly I found the speaker quality pretty good - high max volume and not too airy.

\- No real issues with connectivity; 5G, 4G, Bluetooth, wifi transfer etc.

Overall it works like an android phone. How much you really choose to do with it, that's up to you.

I don't have google account logged in now. This is what I've used

Apps installed currently:

**F-Droid** \- main repository for apps

**Email: Thunderbird** \- this is able to pull Gmail, personal outlook emails successfully without issues. Some more enterprise managed emails wouldn't work, eg I could somehow do it for my work which handles sensitive individual data, but not for my university email.

**Calendar: Fossify Calendar +  DAVx5.** I find this as the simplest combo. You log into Davx5, and log into the calendar clients you want. Fossify will have an option to enable CALDAV sync which is a calendar management standard, and will pull calendars from DAVx5. You can set sync frequencies for battery life etc, eg my priority ones I set for hourly, the more trashy/generic mail stuff I do maybe 4-6 hourly.

Contacts/phone: Frankly the basic phone and contacts work just fine. I've never been one to ever download them even on my primary phones. I suppose without google you lose that spam call filter, but frankly even with it I still used to get heaps of crap. You can download your contacts into an exportable file and transfer it over

**Browser: Fenec** \- works as firefox would, not trouble at all.

**File manager - Amaz**e. Just looks like most standard file managers really. My use is pretty basic. It has options to look for all images, docs, apks etc like most modern file managers do. It is able to do  wifi p2p and FTP servers, but I have not tried it

**VPN** \- NordVPN for some reason this does not work no matter where I get the apk from, ( eg apkpure, apkmirror, or even logging into google play store downloading it and logging out ) . My presumption is that it needs google play services to function somehow. I haven't decided on a VPN client yet.

ChatGPT - does not work , apparently now needs google play services to function

**DuckDuckGo** \- use to prevent tracking, and as a replacement for chat GPT. DDG has their D**uck AI chat that uses currently GPT-40 mini, Llama 4 scout, Claude haiku 3.5 04-mini, Mistral small-3** . I think all those models generally work ok, I use it a research student, they're generally able to spit out pretty good answers. It would be nice for a widget, but you can just hold the icon and an option for Duck AI will come out.

**HereweGo maps -** great alternative, it works really well, an offline maps are a boon. It wont have that detail that google maps has with searching eg restaurants in an area and have reviews menus etc, but if you know where you want to go, no problem. I use it with extreme refresh rate, audio and a bit higher contrast and have been able to navigate successfully ( and stress free, importantly ) in a major city. This is just with my phone mounted to the windshield, not android auto. I mean really, we worked without android auto all these years, and all of a sudden it'a  deal breaker for many ? Do you reallllly need to call someone while driving down the highway? Change your music ?

**Antenna pod - podcasts**. No frills works perfectly well

**APK mirror installation app** to install the apks I get from apkmirror, apkpure. For those who never tried, a lot of apk these days come as "packages" eg apkm apkg so may not be properly installed by the default file installer on your phone, this helps fix that.

**Kotatsu - Manga reader.** I think it is the best out there. Depending on what eink settings you use, you can adjust it to your visual preference. Some say manga isn't optimised for eink reading but it's really well, all black and white so...why wouldn't it be? Unless the select manga has a very high dynamic range of black and whites maybe yes, but that is not the majority of manga drawings, at least all in one panel. It might not look super awesome if its an image of someone with dark black hair, wearing a grey-ish eye patch, lighter black cloak standing in the shadow.

**Texting apps -** It's quite impossible to get away from things like WhatsApp , and Line for some. I didn't know this myself but in WhatsApp there is an option for logging in as a companion phone during setup, so you're not longer stuck having to have your WhatsApp follow your sim card/e-sim. I did it while setting up this phone for a try the first few days, works flawlessly. LINE can be logged in through email as a secondary device, so no problems.

File sending app - **Local sender.** Very useful to send between your phone, PC, other android phones etc. Uses wifi transfer so blazing speed

Reading app - I just **sideloaded Kindle.** I have too many books and uploaded stuff from Kindle. There are many suggested ones out there like Ko reader but nothing can really beat the ease of Kindle.

Launcher - this is a personal preference. The **default installed one is just mega trash.** You can't get rid of the exisiting stuff, so it's a bit like a grandma phone where you have a wall of apps. Who designed it should really be sent to a nursing home only phone designer conference. I swapped it and like **Niagara , OLauncher or lawnchair ( stil buggy )**

You'll notice **I don't have any document viewers.** This is because realistically speaking, even if you hate Microsoft/google, they make the best office suite apps, but only usable if you log into respective accounts on your phones.  Collabra, Libre etc - frankly the android versions suck.

This is not a phone you want to be editing documents on, especially in a coloured fill world.

I simply wait to go home, or use my work PC for it. And frankly, aren't most of us in front of one or have access to one within a few minutes of walking ?

  
So that's my take on it. It's a good phone if you accept what it was made for. It's not a Pixel 9 pro with an eink.

At best its a Samsung A50 something series with an eink screen, minus the long update security promises you get from large companies.</description>

      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/China_irl/comments/1mfjun0/最近关于仇日和浪友的相互指责不断我这里转发一个姜文当初关于电影鬼子来了的访谈我个人很认同姜文的这番话/</link>
      <description>背景：（《鬼子来了》的剧情简述，来自gemini）

&gt; 电影《鬼子来了》的故事发生在中国抗日战争末期，河北挂甲台村。村民马大三家里，某天夜里突然来了两个不速之客——一个叫花屋小三郎的日本兵，和一个叫董汉臣的汉奸翻译官。

&gt; 他们是被自称“我”的土匪绑架来的。土匪把这两个人丢给马大三，命令他看管好，等过年的时候再来取人。土匪走后，马大三把这俩人藏在自己的地窖里，一边悉心照料，一边提心吊胆地等待土匪回来。然而，土匪迟迟没有出现。

&gt; 在这期间，马大三和村民们为如何处理这两个人犯了愁。一开始，大家想直接杀了他们，但又怕惹来日军的报复。后来，在董汉臣的怂恿下，村民们决定和日本人做一笔交易：用这两个俘虏，换取两车粮食。花屋小三郎为了活命，也一口答应了下来，并写了保证书。

&gt; 马大三带着花屋和小董，把他们送到了日军的据点。然而，据点的日军军官根本不认账。就在村民们感到绝望时，花屋小三郎突然对日军据点的军官高喊，表示自己要遵守承诺。最终，村民们真的用这两个人换回了两车粮食。

&gt; 然而，当村民们正在村里庆祝，准备和日军一起联欢时，日军军官却突然翻脸，对手无寸铁的村民们展开了血腥屠杀。侥幸逃脱的马大三在悲痛和愤怒中，来到了日军据点，用土匪留下的斧子砍杀了花屋小三郎和一名日本兵，为村民们报仇。

&gt; 最终，马大三被日本兵抓住，并被判处死刑。在行刑时，行刑的刽子手正是当初被马大三放走的日本兵——花屋小三郎的战友。随着刀光一闪，马大三的人头落地，他的眼睛还保持着睁开的状态。电影的最后，镜头以马大三的视角，记录下了他睁着的双眼，头颅在地上滚动，最终定格在了一个令人震撼的画面上。

***************

1.我为什么要拍“鬼子戏”？　　

姜文说：这部电影不仅是再现日本军队当年的暴行，更是出于一种警世的责任。在这部影片里，日本军屠杀的是真正的中国老百姓、中国平民。而事实上，当年日本军也确实杀过很多中国老百姓。我的老家唐山就发生过这样的惨案。我想通过这部影片告诉日本观众：你们要真正面对这段历史，别想再否认。我也想以此告诫中国观众：面对恶人，我们不能无端地报以善良。面对这些已经发生的事实，中国人和日本人都应该有一个正确的认识，才能避免这种事再发生。

2.我为什么对中日文化比较感兴趣？　　

姜文说：1982年我在中戏上学时，班上来了一拨儿日本留学生，和我们同龄，关系也特好，走的时候依依惜别，甚至有和我们班同学谈恋爱的。当时我就很奇怪，他们和我小时看的抗日电影中的松井之类的日本鬼子说的都是一样的话，怎么态度和人的精神面貌却和松井他们那么不一样？他们和松井他们也就是差一代人，二者形象却怎么也重叠不到一起。从那时起，我就带着这个问题听了很多亲历过抗日战争者的讲述，后来有机会去日本时也看了很多听了很多，看了许多如《菊花与刀》之类的人类学、社会学著作……到现在，我渐渐地能把这两类日本人的形象重叠到一起了，他们其实就是一回事，只不过在不同环境下表现形式不同而已。这就令我毛骨悚然：一个温文尔雅的日本人很容易变成一个我们印象中的日本兵。　　

3.我为什么重视日本这个对手？　　

姜文说：日本善于学习和研究中国，我们面对的是一个有优点的敌人。如果我们不能正视这些优点而是将其模糊掉，不承认它，就会面临失败的危险与灾难。

半个世纪前的那一场侵略战争就是明证。这是每一个中国人都该认真思考的问题，我觉得鲁迅思想的形成和他对国民性的批判，与他年轻时在日本呆过，产生过比较有很大关系。我觉得一场灾难的发生并不可怕，真正可怕的是灾难过后我们不能深入地研究和总结这场灾难的根源。正是这种想法促使我一直想拍一个中日间的故事。

4.我为什么给《鬼子来了》选择刘星的音乐？　　

姜文说：《鬼子来了》的故事原本“隐藏”在我为拍电影而看过的众多小说之中，并没有清晰地凸现出来。而最终诱发灵感的是两张风格迥异的 CD，一盘是日本军歌，另一盘是当代音乐隐士刘星的专辑《一意孤行》。前者激昂有力中带有霸道倾向，后者则尽得中国文化超脱与空灵的真谛。我从日本军歌中听出了民谣式的儿童歌曲的痕迹，其中有一种青春期的无法控制的疯狂和理想，这种疯狂如果被邪恶的力量所引导很容易做出意想不到的暴行。对于《一意孤行》的境界，我非常欣赏。但要想达到这种高境界，必须有“日本军歌”那样的实力做基础，否则只能是“商女不知亡国恨”了。　

5.我为什么特别看重“翻译官”在影片中的作用？　　

姜文说：我曾经选了好几个关于中日战争的题材，其中有《生存》。我看中的就是《生存》中的这一点——一个本来没有介入战争的村庄，突然来了一个日本兵和一个翻译，他们怎样互相面对？而由于这个翻译的作用，本来善良的老百姓不能正确地认识对面的敌人，以至于自大、膨胀，使用了错误的手段。这其中有残暴敌人的问题，更有翻译官因为私欲而误导的问题，于是事情开始往意想不到的方向发展，故事的这个核是我非常看好的。　　

6.我为什么对日本朋友抱有戒心？　　

姜文说：当年在中戏谈笑甚欢的日本留学生朋友，遇到特定的历史环境一瞬间就会变成大屠杀的刽子手。这种两面性是很好地重叠在日本人身上的。就像我们这一代人很熟悉的李玉和与鸠山，在满铁医院的时候就是“老朋友”嘛！但是这种朋友关系挡不住鸠山当了宪兵队队长，以后把李玉和弄来坐老虎凳。虽然不耽误请李玉和喝杯酒、谈谈佛教，但是密电码得拿出来。这种事太多了，朋友归朋友、原则归原则，日本人的原则性和国家利益的概念非常强。　　

7.我为什么不总把“爱国主义”挂在嘴边？　　

姜文说：爱国主义不需要唤起，只要一个人还知道自己是谁，对自己的人格有一定的尊重，他就会爱自己的祖国。鲁迅对自己民族与文化中某些问题进行讽刺与挖苦，这也是充满了爱的。他为什么不挖苦日本去呀？因为他是想让中国这“脖没了，比日本强了，这是最大的爱国。反过来个别人为了自己的私欲违心地故作赞扬歌颂状，而不让人们看到问题的实质，那就像我们片子中的翻译官董汉臣一样了。我觉得比“卖国贼”更可怕的是“爱国贼”，他们打着“爱国”的旗号，危害却比“卖国”还大。我虽然达不到鲁迅那么高的境界，但我很崇拜和欣赏他。他有时候表现得比较尖刻，但他看问题很准确。而与之形成鲜明对比的是很多人看不到问题、不愿意看到问题或者看到了也不愿意说。鲁迅这种高境界我理解就是“民族魂”。要是有那么几百个鲁迅，这个国家就会很了不起。　　

8.我为什么不经常站出来对日本右翼势力的否认战争罪行之类的言行加以驳斥？

姜文说：因为拍了这部《鬼子来了》，近期有不少报纸请我就日本右翼分子的反动言论发表看法。但是我认为我们最需要的不是每次日本反华势力出招的时候我们就接招，而是需要从深层次上研究这个对手，光靠拉几个名人出来义愤填膺地过一把嘴瘾无济于事。日本对中国的态度始终没有变过，只是我们没有深入地认识到这一层，所以才一会儿看着是一衣带水的友好邻邦，一会儿看着又是军国主义的复活，这是我们需要反省的。日本不断利用我们在群情激昂时说过的一些过嘴瘾的话来达到他们的某种目的，包括我们的一些电影都成了他们开脱罪责的例证。比如我们老拍游击队，他们就援引有关的国际战争法称游击队员被俘后不享受正规军的战俘待遇，为他们杀人找借口。再比如我们有一句著名的电影台词叫“一百多鬼子，二百多伪军”，他们又非常险恶地把很多杀戮的罪行推卸到中国的伪军身上。问题不在于最近日本又发出了什么不和谐的声音，我们该怎样回击，而是在于我们应该冷静地认识我们面对的是一个什么样的邻居。我们总说要走向世界，首先就得迈过日本这道门坎。迈过日本，自然就走向世界了。　　

9.我为什么不在影片中让中国观众痛痛快快地“打”鬼子？　　

姜文说：拍这部电影还有一个目的，就是改变一些抗战题材的“老片”可能会给人，尤其是给日本观众造成的一些误解。从历史的角度来看，那些片子都是很好的，确实起到了教育人民、打击敌人的作用。但这些电影也有一些问题。比如说，这些老电影被日本人拿到日本去放，并以此教育日本的年轻人说：你们看，中国的老百姓哪一个不是间谍，他们哪个不是不穿军装的军人？既然他们“全民皆兵”，我们就可以对他们“全民歼灭”。于是，我们的这些老电影成了他们掩盖当年屠杀中国平民的把柄。但事实上，那时候我们并没有“全民皆兵”，那只是我们的一个理想。而我们现在拍电影，就再不能给日本人这种口实了。我觉得通过拍一部电影过嘴瘾是容易的，而且往往能很急功近利地讨点好，但是事情过去之后既不起作用又不能使观众真正进行思考。我拍《鬼子来了》就是试图让观众明白，如果想避免我们大家都知道的那段不愉快的历史，除了过嘴瘾还有什么办法。我不敢说《鬼子来了》给出了这个结论，事实上我一个导演和一部影片也做不到，最高的理想也就是有个方向吧！　　

10.我为什么不相信日本人的“友好”？　　

姜文说：在与日本人特别是日本年轻人的交往过程中我发现，日本右翼分子、反华势力、否认战争罪行的大有人在，并不像我们常说的那样是一小撮，只不过在那里上蹿下跳的是一小撮。不认识到这一点我们就等于没有正视日本这个强大的对手。另一个不好的倾向是：我们有些文艺作品经常替日本人向中国人谢罪。

而事实上不肯谢罪的日本人是一大撮，我们为什么总要用那一小撮谢罪的日本人来麻醉和满足自己呢？《鬼子来了》这部影片中有几位日本演员，他们以前看过我拍的《阳光灿烂的日子》，很想和我合作，报酬都好商量。但是看了剧本以后，他们有抵触情绪，拍摄过程中我们也不断发生辩论。这批30岁左右的日本演员代表着日本的中坚力量，通过这部电影，我或多或少地改变了他们一些比较极端的想法。我相信将来这部影片在日本上演时，观众也会像这批演员一样有所改变，至少对自己以往接受的看法有某种怀疑。</description>

      <title>中国地方规划师发现 GDP 无限增长的奇怪方法</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mfnu3g</link>
      <description>中国约有三分之一的省份实际上已经破产，地方政府的每一元收入都用于支付利息和债券，而没有用于任何公共服务的资金。

这张图表上的100%表示所有收入都用于偿还债务。以天津为例，相当于一个年薪5万美元的人每年要偿还10万美元的债务。

多年来的增长指令迫使各省通过地方政府融资平台举债，用于基础设施和房地产扩张，远远超出了地方税基的承受能力。这种制度造成了不正当的激励机制，地方官员无论财政可持续性如何，都因GDP增长而获得奖励，从而引发了借贷和建设的竞相竞争。

财政收入在2021年达到29万亿元人民币的峰值，此后持续下降，并在2025年上半年进一步下降，预计全年约为26.4万亿元人民币，其中土地出让收入较峰值下降44%。许多省份目前依靠债务常青化、中央转移支付和救助来维持生计。

本图表中的数据来自加州大学圣地亚哥分校21世纪中国研究中心的Victor Shih 和Jonathan Elkobi 所著的《中国 地方政府债务动态》 。

      <title>90%国男都禁受不住杨某媛的攻势</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/China_irl/comments/1mfcs77/90国男都禁受不住杨某媛的攻势/</link>
      <description>今天看了她和某个报纸记者的对话，一共10多分钟，两边唇枪舌剑硝烟弥漫。此人非常精明，绝对不会让对方抓到把柄，而且说话习惯用攻势，打对方一个措手不及。这个视频在b站还能找到，而且是她主动上传的

还有一个插曲，翻她论文时候发现结尾又有一处训斥男人的行为。仅仅凭借吵架对话的脑补，就把男人骂的畏畏缩缩（这个帖子现在在时间线上）

我们再回顾一下杨同学的行为

步骤分析：

1.	⁠先是对肖同学口头进攻，逼对方签道歉信。可以从道歉信看出，肖同学是非常怂而且祈求认错的态度
2.	⁠诉诸权力：事后找辅导员，辅导员不认定性骚扰。再闹大到学院，院长调查监控之后之后依然不认定性骚扰
3.	⁠诉诸舆论：在武大百年校庆之前，挑选一个时间点引发舆论，打出了统战价值，让校方不得不应对让事件降温。从而对肖同学进行处分和取消保研资格
4.	⁠诉诸法律：上法院起诉，想让肖同学接受法律意义上的惩戒，这件事如果成功了，那肖同学一定回坐牢和退学，以后考公考编找工作很难，人生彻底毁了。目前的结果是败诉，杨同学肯定会持续上诉。
5.	⁠言语骚扰：在败诉之后，杨同学在b站里说会一直对他进行举报，直到他的单位不堪其扰辞退他，让肖同学没办法生活工作

她为什么在微博 b站这么嚣张和扬武扬威，就是因为她在气势上一直是进攻的，在男人面前赢的太多了，只需略微出手就能让男人在她面前屈服退缩

这两个例子，一个是被她闹大的性骚扰例子，一个是被她写进论文的例子。这两个男人的认错和认怂就是她的胜利成果，会让她一直这样保持下去。我猜生活中肯定还有其他的例子，让她对男人保持连胜

还有人装瞎说没有性别对立，这就是最好的例子。杨同学就是把男人看成敌人，用尽一切手段让对方屈服

当然我觉得国男本身也有问题，90%的国男换到肖同学的处境，到现在结果估计会差不多。一方面还保留着不跟女斗的传统思想，面对女人就自动放下武器，觉得女人肯定有苦衷。另一方面是缺少斗争经验，面对敌意和斗争不知道怎么应对，一味退缩。再一个就是要脸，太有道德底线，不知道对方有多少恶意让你死。

甄嬛传那是女人的必修课，没有女人没看过。女人堆里明争暗斗可太多了，只是很多国男没接触过，还沉静在女人都是香香软软的想象之中

现在是大斗争时代，杨同学的行为会被效仿成榜样。我的建议是国男也要把自己武装起来。至少学会防御，绝不认错，认错就是给对方把柄不断进攻。必要时候学美国，美国人遇到纠纷和公权力就保持沉默叫律师，国男可以摇人叫有社会经验的人，会吵架的人参与进来，反正国人喜欢吃瓜。学会防御再学进攻，该吵架就吵架，气势上不能输。面对诉诸公权力和制度的行为，那就有样学样，扒对方论文，生活作风，言行举止，找对方的所有漏洞寻求制度惩罚</description>

      <title>作为一名乌克兰人，我是否支持泽连斯基？</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/China_irl/comments/1mfd6ou/作为一名乌克兰人我是否支持泽连斯基/</link>
      <description>这个问题我已经听过很多遍了。
在社交媒体上，在外国朋友面前，在陌生人评论区里。
甚至在瑞典街头，一位瑞典老太太听说我是乌克兰人，停顿了一下，然后问：“你们的总统……他真的那么勇敢吗？”

我一时不知道怎么回答。不是因为没有答案，而是因为这个问题太简单，也太复杂。

⸻

泽连斯基刚当上总统的时候，乌克兰其实是个很分裂的国家。
他来自克里维里赫，是说俄语的东部人。刚上任时，他推行的是“对话政策”——频繁与普京会面，希望能通过谈判解决顿巴斯的问题。
那几年，很多人不信任他，说他太软弱，说他会再次让乌克兰被出卖。
那些批评并不是无的放矢。我们经历过2014年亲俄政府的伤疤，我们知道“对话”有时候只是另一种形式的投降。

直到2022年2月，一切都变了。

⸻

我还记得那一晚。爆炸声在远方，社交媒体里混乱一片。很多人开始打包、撤离、抢购食品和水。就在那时候，泽连斯基发出那段视频，站在黑暗中的街道上，说：

“我们都在这里。我们不会投降。”

那一瞬间，好像什么东西变了。
不只是他变了，而是我们全都变了。


战争第三年了。前线没有什么“胜利新闻”，越来越多的公民收到征兵通知，或者干脆从街头“失踪”了。
我有个老朋友，下楼买烟的工夫，被四个大汉从面包车里拽走，什么都没查，就因为他是个年轻男人。
在乌克兰，ТЦК（征兵中心）已经成了一个臭名昭著的存在。
你在网上能看到有人在街头逃跑，有陌生人伸手拉他们上车、开走。
这已经不是电影，也不是过去了。

⸻

话说回来，我人在瑞典，法律上我现在是“受保护的人”。
但这种保护也只是一个标签罢了。
三年来，我们无法申请任何其他居留身份，不能转换为工作许可、学生签或任何长期居留。战争结束前，一切都挂在“临时”上。
如果战争结束后要遣返回国，很多人的“家”早已不在了——被炸成废墟的，或者被俄罗斯“接管”的。
那我们到底应该回到哪里？

⸻

西方的援助越来越慢，政策越来越模糊。
曾经的承诺，如今像背诵不熟的台词：义正辞严，但没有行动。
你甚至能感觉到他们也在“等”：等我们撑不住，等形势反转，等某个合理的时机，把责任撇干净。

中国呢？
他们至少没说支持我们，也没演戏。
他们说中立，也确实表面中立。我们知道他们在做什么，但他们没假装是什么救世主。

———

有时候我会回想，如果那天晚上他没有出现在镜头前，会发生什么？
如果他当时选择了离开、逃避或者妥协，我们还会团结吗？
这场战争，会不会早就以另一种方式结束了？

也许我们不是靠什么伟大战略撑到现在的。
是因为有人在该走的时候没有走，在该妥协的时候说了“不”，在最需要希望的时候说出了“我在”。
有时候，一个人没有逃跑，就足以让一整个民族坚持下去。

这也许从来就不是“支持”或“反对”的问题。
有些时候，问题不是你站在哪一边，而是你心底还敢不敢相信——
相信勇气有意义，相信坚持不是徒劳。
相信在这条看不到尽头的路上，还有一些东西，值得你不回头。

———

我不是什么学者，也不是谁的代言人。
我只是个还没能回家的人，一个在异国边界间等待的人。
等一个不再被“临时”定义的身份，
等一个比签证、法律、和援助条文更长久的归属感。</description>
