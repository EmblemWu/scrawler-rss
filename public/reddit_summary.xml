      <description>I was super young when I got this ~ honestly have no idea what possessed me to spend that much on a dress back then 😂
But turns out it was worth every cent. I’ve been into fashion ever since I can remember lol.

10 years later, the fabric, structure, and fit are *still* amazing (though yes, my body definitely changed haha).

      <description>Hello,

Where I can find German dicts audio files for my Onyx Boox? I would like to use pronunciation sound feature from our dicts app. E.G. ror the purposes of English language, I have 3 files:  
config.json  
Sound-en\_GB.mddindex  
Sound-en\_GB.mdd

and works flawlessly.

So assume I need to find similar for DE language. Please support :)</description>

      <title>Interested in an e-ink phone</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1m8emw9/interested_in_an_eink_phone/</link>
      <description>Hello e-ink redditors.   
I'm looking to understand if and which e-ink phone is right for me.  
None of the posts I've read seem to apply to me. So I'm posting to you all.  
  
As a preface, I'm a 37 year old. I don't have social medias and I look at my phone on average 10 minutes a day. My interest in e-ink phones has nothing to do with de-socialization or screen time or any of the stuff that many of these posts seem to be about. My current phone is a Huawei Enjoy 10. I live in Europe.

I'm interested in e-ink because I love my paper-white kindle, daylight visibility, clean UI (I use a gruvbox palette on my desktop), and a phone with that design sounds great.   
I need it to:

* make calls, 
* use WhatsApp, 
* browse the web if I'm sitting on the tram, (Wikipedia normally)
* use Obsidian if I need to make notes
* access my bank app

Those are the only things I use my phone for. I usually bought old models, but now I've started having unsupported app issues (and the Huawei/Google fiasco). So I'm looking to change.

In all my life, I've never paid more than a hundred bucks on a phone. I'm willing to push 250, but the idea of paying 400+ on something to check WhatsApp and make notes when I'm out of the house seems insane.

This puts me in the running for a Hisense A5, BOOX Palma 2, and Bigme Hibreak. I'm not sure if there are other options, or if these ones are good enough. Too many reviews talk subjectively about performance (slow, load times, eye strain), but with no scientific or analytical reference points for me to compare to my current phone.

Am I SOL in my search for a phone like this without being an addict?</description>

      <description>Hi, 
I have had a kindle for about 10 years. I am looking at replacing it soon.

Here are wants/needs:
• the ability to download Hoopla for my library books
• ability to write and take notes 
• color would be awesome, and preferred, I do love to draw and would probably use it for such. 
• 7”-10” screen 

What are the options you guys would recommend and why do you think it’s superior to another?</description>

      <title>Yet another case of a BOOX device's screen breaking on its own, with the company refusing to pay for the repairs</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1m8br0q/yet_another_case_of_a_boox_devices_screen/</link>
      <description>Hi, this is another story like many I've seen in this subreddit and others, but I need to vent for a bit. I have a Tab Mini C whose screen broke twice. The first time, I managed to get the repairs for free because it was within the (arbitrary) 1-year warranty from BOOX, but this second time, and despite me being the most careful I could, the screen suddenly got a line of dead pixels overnight, with more soon to follow.

Despite arguing with BOOX, they decided on their own that the screen broke due to an "external force" and asked for an outrageous 270USD to replace it. For that amount of money I can buy an equivalent device from their competitors, so obviously I'm not having it repaired. For the record, the device never fell to the ground or had any force applied to it, because I *know* just how fragile these screens are. But I still carried it around in a backpack in a normal tablet case, because **it's a portable device**. It still broke anyway, but obviously I have no way of proving it wasn't my fault. I also have a BOOX B&amp;W tablet, which is much older, but is still kicking and showing no signs of degradation, despite me carrying for both devices the same way (I was probably more careful with the Tab Mini C). These things are way too fragile and at the very least the company should warn customers about it, instead of selling devices that can just break on their own.

Even more frustratingly, despite being in the EU, the seller also refuses to enforce the mandatory 2-year warranty. So I'm stuck with a 450 USD brick. Anyone has any ideas what I can do with it? lol

So yeah. Don't buy BOOX color e-readers. Not worth the gamble. These things can't be used as a normal tablet because of how fragile they are. And BOOX is anti-customer, not believing I didn't break it myself. Great way to build a reputation.</description>

      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1m8p9a3/kindle_vs_boox_poke/</link>
      <description>As title says, im considering to get one and still can’t decide 😭

i was thinking of getting Boox Poke as I wanted to download an ebook app (non-english) but some reviews about its fragile screen worried me. 

I won’t use Kindle app but will deffo use Epubs on it. Since i alr have my ipad, If Kindle is way better than the Poke boox i’ll use the Ebook app on my ipad and use Kindle for Epub.

What are your thoughts/ suggestions on this?
help😭

I’m totally fine with the battery life, so my main focus is the screen/ interface design/ reading experience at night</description>

      <title>Troubles of working with standard LED/LCD screen disappear with the new OLED screen/eink screen</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1m8ucgu/troubles_of_working_with_standard_ledlcd_screen/</link>
      <description>Troubles of working with standard LED/LCD screen disappear with the new OLED screen/eink screenI am in Hong Kong, China. I am 33 years old.Since I started using personal computers in college, I've been troubled by a persistent issue for over a decade: I feel extremely uncomfortable when looking at standard LED/LCD monitors. Tasks like reading e-books or writing emails cause significant discomfort and severely impact my cognitive abilities. For instance, when I use an iPad and Apple Pencil to solve math problems, my performance deteriorates; I cannot think of the solution of moderate level mathematics questions and it takes much longer to complete them. In contrast, when I use pen and paper, I experience no discomfort, and my thinking becomes much clearer. Similarly, I prefer drafting articles on paper before typing them on a computer, as writing directly on a computer results in lower-quality work due to the discomfort from the screen. Sometimes, after using an LED/LCD monitor for two hours, I feel so exhausted that I need to take a nap.The following tasks are particularly uncomfortable when performed on standard LED/LCD monitors:

1. Coding
2. Writing
3. Using software like Word, Excel, Canva
4. Solving mathematics questions (e.g., Olympiad problems, university-level math, HKDSE math questions)
5. Reading

Over the past decade, this issue has significantly affected my performance on computer-related tasks. I try to complete various tasks using pen and paper whenever possible. For example, I draft emails and articles on paper before typing them on the computer. Similarly, I solve math problems on paper before inputting them into the computer. I thought this problem would affect me for the rest of my life.  
  
I believe the issue is likely related to the monitor. My first discovery was that e-ink displays (such as Kindle and Philips Business Monitor Electronic Paper Display 13B1K3300/27) alleviated my discomfort. When using these e-ink screens, the problems I experienced with LED/LCD screens almost completely disappeared. However, e-ink screens are limited to black and white and have slow refresh rates.  
  
Recently, I discovered something new. I purchased an OLED laptop (Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 4) and found that looking at the OLED screen felt similar to looking at paper. I did not experience the discomfort I previously had with LED/LCD screens. Why is this the case?**Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 4 OLED Screen Specifications:**

* Display Type: 13.3-inch OLED touchscreen
* Resolution: 2880 x 1800 pixels (2.8K)
* Aspect Ratio: 16:10
* Color Gamut: 100% DCI-P3
* Brightness: 400 nits
* Contrast Ratio: 1,000,000:1
* Refresh Rate: 60Hz
* Touch Support: 10-point multi-touch
* Pen Support: Compatible with Lenovo's Precision Pen
* Surface Treatment: Anti-glare, anti-reflection, and anti-fingerprint

I am considering trying an external OLED monitor with similar specifications. However, I would like to test the monitor for 2-3 hours before purchasing to ensure it does not cause discomfort, as I am unsure if a new OLED screen will be the same as the one on the Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 4. If I purchase an OLED screen that differs from the Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 4's OLED screen and still causes discomfort, it would be a waste.I have briefly researched some OLED screens:

* Philips 27-inch Evnia 2K QHD QD-OLED 240Hz Gaming Monitor 27M2N6500
* Samsung 27-inch Odyssey G6 OLED QHD 360Hz Gaming Monitor LS27DG602SCXXK
* LG 32-inch UltraGear 4K UHD OLED 240Hz Gaming Monitor 32GS95UE-B

I plan to try using the above OLED screens.Are there any doctors (ophthalmologists?) who can explain this issue? I am willing to pay a substantial fee to consult a doctor who can identify the cause and provide a solution. Has anyone experienced similar problems?</description>

      <description>Left to right: Kindle Paperwhite 11th Gen, Minimal Phone, SuperNote A6X

Early days with the Minimal Phone. While I can't recommend it in it's current state (software is too buggy), I'm personally happy to manage and workaround its issues for the form factor. 

Reading on the Minimal Phone is a nicer way to pass the time when I'm out compared to scrolling feeds. Also syncing back to my Paperwhite for a more comfortable, relaxed reading experience is nice. The SuperNote has been my digital writing tablet for years now and (while a bit aged) hasn't let me down.</description>

      <title>给那个900块报警没结果的回帖，一不小心写太长了发布了评论</title>

      <description>那么我也说一下经历，之前在龙岗布吉酒店做保安的时候报过警，酒店旁边是有小卖部的。

做保安是处理客户纠纷，大堂经理有事情跟顾客吵起来了，我过去劝了一下架严格，警察过来了一个人，不过当时不知道，按照我现在的理解，警察出警应该是两个人才对。没做什么事情，就劝和了一下。不了了之。

第二次，客户要上楼但是没有房卡刷电梯门，因为当时管控，进酒店要登记，便利店的小姐姐有电梯卡给帮忙刷了一下，警察知道了，拿走了便利店的房卡，向小姐姐勒索了要两包芙蓉王。只是虚空叫了两声，我没说话，心里面有点歉意，给小姐姐的男朋友买了一包芙蓉王，当然没明面给，只是自己抽了一根说，不想抽了，剩下的给店长。（店长是便利店小姐姐的男朋友）。

后面么，酒店单独报了一次警，（报警没有我是不知道的）说住酒店的客人说我盗窃了他的金表。说真的我就算是小偷也不至于在自己干活的地方偷东西，这不是给自己找不自在吗？何况酒店还有我的入职简历，写了家庭住址和家庭人员信息。我回忆了一下那是180的单间房子，那是17年吧。那间房子我很有影响，因为那是一个我的老乡广东口音，四五个人住的一个单间，还带着一个小孩子，推着婴儿车。晚上入住不久因为房间水不够热搬去了其他房间，我还好像帮忙推一下婴儿车。那时候还想这家人真穷，四五个人住一个单间，后面次日白天醒来酒店老板就给我打了电话，不是酒店经理，（酒店经理跟我住在一起，这人也聪明知道转移矛盾，让老板解决，不过现在想想这个事报告给了老板，应该是想解决掉我），问了一下，我说真不是我做的，我也没发誓，过后晚上上班的时候，到白班问了保洁，说是找到了，客人金表在床头的缝隙哪里，说五六个人找没找到。按照性格分析保洁的老公是开公司的应该不会贪这玩意，何况说话的语气也不想偷了之后再还回去。貌似这个事情之后我也不帮人了，反噬太严重了。当然以前多多少少会帮一点。其实也能理解穷人拥有的东西本来就少，少去一点东西，就很要命。

后面打工碰到劳务派遣。说了一下结工资跟之前说好的不一样，本来应该是13块一小时算到11块一小时，打了110问了一下，那是17年底吧，深圳宝安那边，警察的回复是这种事情归劳动局管。那时候心很凉。这是官？比当年北京王府井雪深到膝盖凌晨没公交回宿舍还冷，不过幸好当时有肯德基的店铺可以坐一下熬过夜晚还不赶人。所以我对警察不怎么报希望。

我回忆了一下，如果是大公司或者或者比较出名的连锁店，报警是很快的，中医院就有过报警，警察还因为十分钟没有准时到达给我们表示一下歉意。医院的火警也是链接派出所的，当时误报，警察打来座机电话，态度也很客气，这大概是强权的味道，虽然我只是个小保安。

言归正转吧，报警没用是在我过往的经历里面总结的出来的，当然碰到事情还是得报警录音录像。起码上法庭也不至于两手空空，口说无凭。不过就op说的一千块得人敢花一百块打车？我是不敢的，但是每个人思路不一样。也许人家就喜欢这样呢。不过这个司机也被开户了。不过后续么，没见到。上面说得劳务派遣进厂打工也碰到过晚上买饭吃给摆摊老板多转几百块得，但是老板给回去了。只能说人这东西一样米养百样人</description>

      <title>死于910元的鹤壁19岁男孩：比铅更毒比粪水更脏的，是吹散正义的风</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/China_irl/comments/1m87q6d/死于910元的鹤壁19岁男孩比铅更毒比粪水更脏的是吹散正义的风/</link>
      <description>这起案件某种程度上，比天水余杭更丢中国人的脸。

男孩心理偏激，对自己的死亡确实负有很大责任；但我们可以只退回他「受到伤害」这一点，从警察的回复，到新闻的评论区，这起案件尤其**简单又清楚地**投射出，今天中国社会所遍布的病态的现实主义倾向。

一个真正文明的社会，在这则新闻下一定会出现的质问明明应该是：为什么男孩的家人老师朋友甚至代表社会公正秩序的警察，统统没有告诉他「这是司机不对，不怪你，如果不怕麻烦，法院会给你主持公道」，告诉他，**别绝望，这个世界有「正义」**。

它固然一方面源自整个体制从上到下，一桩桩一件件的不公案件得不到「善终」，一次次对法治信念冲击，让法治精神被亵渎；但一方面也是一代人出自内心了的，对公平正义美德**动摇**与**轻视**。

这种「算了接受这样的世界」，这种对公平正义的「不相信」「不奢望」，是我始终觉得，今天中国人最可悲也最可耻的地方。

因为背负「落后就要挨打」的群体创伤，于是就光明正大丧失对公平正义的信念，甚至**反向异化**出一种对「愿意相信公平正义」的**纠错倾向**，去批判「白莲花、圣母、清高与天真」，去坚持一种自认为更有现实价值的「道德无用论」。

（殊不知正义与道德感，就像公平信念之于契约精神一样，文明发展必不可少的基础资源——一个不相信商业合同有效的社会，就不会有经济进步；同理一个不相信正义，默认「社会上只看谁的拳头硬」的世界，只会让每个个体不断付出「多防范」「多小心」「加倍保护自己」的额外成本。）

这阵「默认正义不会有结果」的风，导致了中国人各种「只能提前预防不公」的过激行为：因为不相信插队会被管理，所以一股脑争先；因为不相信资源会被公平分配，所以一窝蜂哄抢；所谓的中国游客特有的「不文明倾向」，常常就是不相信**文明秩序最终一定会被执行**的表现。

今天走在中国的街道上，你固然不必担心从夜色里窜出两个抢匪，可是却始终得不到「正义会被伸张」的笃定与安全感。诚然，同样的不公不正，同样的司法纰漏/制度冷漠，在发达国家也会出现——但如此深刻普遍的，几乎被全社会默认的对正义观念的怀疑与不信任，却是罕见。

所以每当有人说，中国人总是被他们其中的一些人保护得很好，我就止不住恶心——躺在山野里19岁男孩冰冷的尸体与心，究竟谁试过保护他。</description>

他们可能是想入党的学生，

想出狱的踩缝纫机人员，

但有时候，不由得我们不好奇一下，

他们的精神状态。

众所周知，几年前有个网评员，

加班加点，太累猝死了。

但他猝死的时间点过于靠近某个节日，

为了不让老爷不开心，

所以，更多的网评员，包括了此猝死的网评员的同事们，

加班加点，删除有关猝死网评员的所有信息。

黑色幽默，莫过于此。

最近什么火车闷热不砸窗，

黄杨是假货，

发现了大量洗地的水军。

因此，真的很好奇，什么样的水军能有如此坚强的神经？

他们日复一日，年复一年，

看到这些负面信息，

但还要写一些正面的文字，

难道不会精神分裂吗？

他们怎么能坚持下去？

后来我想明白了，

太简单了。

他们一定是有一个绩效比例。

写的字不够多，或者不够真诚，

可能会被做成器官，

为祖国换取美金，

或者放入老爷体内，

延年益寿。

老秦人就和那个猝死的网评员一样，

活着当下，只看今天明天有没有饭吃。

铁拳砸自己头上，自己呼天抢地，边上旁观者冷笑。

铁拳没砸自己头上，自己看着呼天抢地的傻逼冷笑。

只有这样，

才能解释得通老秦人的精神状态，

基本上就是，随便活活的这个样子，

也不是不行。

fin 

  
ps. 所以不要再问为什么中国人不修逻辑。因为如果修，会精神分裂的。</description>

      <title>世大运台贺电遭中方抢夺  中媒：上前核实，台方推搡</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m8n3c1</link>
      <description>德国之声报道，在德国世界大学生运动会跆拳道颁奖后，台湾银牌选手欲接受写有“中华民国教育部长”贺电时，两名身穿“中国”字样外套、被指为中国大学生体育协会人员冲上混采区拍摄并试图抢夺贺电，又指“（他们）违反规定”，一直发问“写的是‘中华台北’吗？



新华网刊登中国学生体育联合会说明，说明先批评民进党借体育谋“独”挑衅，又称台方携带含“中华民国”贺电违反“奥运模式”和国际大体联礼宾规定，中方人员仅在“核实、取证”，更指台方人员态度蛮横、言语恶劣、动作粗鲁，不停推搡中国代表团工作人员。



台湾总统赖清德严厉谴责事件。陆委会表示“奥运模式”并未禁止贺电用语，颁发写有“中华民国”贺电是天经地义。

      <title>共产党恨中国人系列：上海警察嘲笑那个转错帐的男孩导致其自杀</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/China_irl/comments/1m8qnk2/共产党恨中国人系列上海警察嘲笑那个转错帐的男孩导致其自杀/</link>
      <description>身为警察，作为一个公职人员，对遇到困难的老百姓不同情，反而嘲笑他，你们共产党就是这样为人民服务的吗？

一个普通人加入共产党后，就慢慢的对老百姓没有同情心了，共产党体制对人的异化。

网络上之前“去公安局吃饺子”成为一个热梗，什么一个字消耗一个领导，现在一个老百姓因为警察的嘲讽而死，没有一个领导下台。

中国人对警察的祛魅就是第一次报警，这些这个男生付出了生命的代价。

这个男生以前肯定是很相信警察，相信共产党，但是他第一次报警却被警察嘲笑，他对共产党和警察的相信，这个时候缺对他造成了致命打击。

中国警察就是共产党来镇压中国老百姓的，为人民服务的要你是外国人。

[警察态度不好还嘲讽受害者傻](https://preview.redd.it/m96zsyv1qyef1.jpg?width=576&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=501352355a4417f850dbd89a71ebf94d651ea9f2)



如果那个男生是外国人，情况就是这样了

      <title>OK, I'm sorry but the Free to play has to go.</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/1m80i7f/ok_im_sorry_but_the_free_to_play_has_to_go/</link>
      <description>Now I'm all for getting more players into the game, but the main problem is that the cheater epidemic has only gotten worse since the switch. It's more rare to get a lobby without a cheater now and the reason being that all they need to do is make a new account and they keep on cheating. And it's not even subtle hacking either, it's blatant rage cheating. And Battle-eye is basically useless. I don't know how hard it would be to switch anti-cheat providers but something needs to be done. 

We need to do one of a few things

1. Lock all new accounts in a separate pool until they play enough games for them to get caught before being allowed access to general pool, however this would be bad for legit new players as they would be stuck with said cheaters and make a bad impression.

  
2. Make a cheater pool where instead of banning them, it forces them to play in that pool forever always against other cheaters, which would be entertaining to watch sometimes. It wouldn't tell them they've been moved to said pool so it would take them longer to make a new account to terrorize the General pool which is this methods downside unless the anti-cheat detection could be improved.

  
3. Revert the Free to play change, Maybe lower the price of the base game a bit from it's old price but at least when you need to own the game to play, it's harder for cheaters to make a new account and jump back in. Downside being it's also less new legit players joining the game due to the cost.

Until Ubi does something to solve the blatant cheater epidemic, Please TK your team-mate if they are without a doubt Cheating if possible. Have some pride and self respect to not allow a cheater to have their way.</description>

      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/1m8p0vy/i_dont_understand_how_uplay_is_still_so_bad/</link>
      <description>Why do you force this software on us and put 0 effort into making it pleasant to use. You even go through all the trouble to rebrand it as "Ubisoft Connect" which btw is just a straight up worse name.  But nothing is different.  All the same bugs and issues and sluggishness.  So many issues with this garbage it would be pointless for me to list each and every one of them because 1) I don't have all night and 2) They would never fix it anyway.

Here's some advice though in case they might take it should their hearts soften from a miracle.  FOR PC GAMES USE STEAM.</description>

      <title>How the hell do you even play R6 on a controller?!?!?</title>
      <link>https://i.redd.it/zc33ns1witef1.jpeg</link>
      <description>How is it even possible to play properly on it? I’ve been playing for a few months now on a PS5 controller and I just can’t aim or shoot normally at all. And when I see how others play, I just don’t get how they can track targets on this piece of shit. The sensitivity is also messed up as hell. When I set it high, I can’t keep my aim steady; when I set it low, I can’t adjust in time. Is it even fucking possible to play properly?


I always played R6 on PC, but recently I bought a PS5 because my PC is too old.</description>

      <title>Making Holes Through Floors with Thermite Charges</title>
      <link>https://v.redd.it/mxi5g8968xef1</link>
      <description>Brilliant idea for Thermite

Why not allow thermite to make his own holes through floors? Thermite melts metal and the explosion in the charge after melting metal causes holes to be made which is how it works irl. If thermite places a charge on the floor that has metal beams inside of it why not let a hole be created. You could even do this with Maverick’s blowtorch and only him and Thermite can do this. (I used the e3 trailer as a reference. And I’m the not first one to come up with this idea.) 

Overpowered..? Kinda. I’m sure Ubi thought of this but saw how crazy it was. At least let Maverick be able to do it.</description>
