      <title>Diatomaceous earth bath mat, defect?</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1met7tl/diatomaceous_earth_bath_mat_defect/</link>
      <description>Bought a dark grey Diatomaceous earth stone bath mat from Amazon. It was a more expensive one. 

When I first used it, the bottoms of my feet look like I dragged it in the dirt. There was a film of a dark grey substance that covered my feet. So then I figured I probably needed to rinse it off before first use. I brought it into the shower to spray it down, and the water that came off of it was a muddy dark grey. No matter how many times I tried cleaning it, there was muddy grey water coming from it that would bleed onto anything that it made contact with. 

Could I have received a defective mat? I’m convinced my feet shouldnt be black after a shower, no matter how good it is at drying.

A white one, although perhaps less visible, doesn’t really seem to solve the underlying concern here though, which is the color bleed. 

Any thoughts?</description>

      <title>Any good camouflage canvas jackets?</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1meom5r/any_good_camouflage_canvas_jackets/</link>
      <description>Looking for a strong canvas jacket preferably in a vintage looking camouflage. The dream coat for me would be the duck camo hunting jackets carhartt made in the 80s/90s, but I either can never find one in my size or it’s a pissing match of an auction (fuck the carhartt resale market). I’ve been looking at the Filson canvas outfitter jacket, as I like the older looking camouflage pattern and the style of jacket, but surprise surprise they only have XS in stock. Any suggestions? I’m 6’3 and usually 250+lbs and it’s hard to find shit in my size sometimes. Doesn’t have to be too warm, I grew up in the Great Lakes and can handle cold winters. I’m getting desperate lol.</description>

      <title>Is there a way to tell what kind of wood a piece of furniture is made from?</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1meph7l/is_there_a_way_to_tell_what_kind_of_wood_a_piece/</link>
      <description>I’ve been slowly replacing my early adulthood “disposable” furniture with quality vintage pieces that will last (hopefully) for life. I’m starting to collect pieces from a Bassett line where the wood is described as “walnut finish,” but in researching where to get additional pieces, many sellers simply call it walnut furniture, which seems like incomplete info. The piece I already own has the original finish and has a very warm tone, more-so than I would expect for walnut. But it is 60ish years old I know the material may have changed color significantly since it was first constructed. There is veneer, but I don’t know much about woodworking and am wondering if it is possible to use walnut construction and cover it with more visually appealing pieces of walnut veneer? This seems unlikely. It was extremely heavy when I moved it - it’s definitely a hardwood and completely solid. 

The original brochure doesn’t get specific and I’m hoping to see what wood I actually have. Mostly I’d like to find pieces to add to my home that will end up aging with a similar look. Any tips on how to get this info (do the codes on the back of the furniture mean anything?) would be so appreciated!

Thank you!

      <description>A long while back when visiting some random friends of my parents, I noticed they had these night lights, or guide lights in the hallway. These lights were amazing as they let of soft easy light, just enough to see where you’re going, using motion sensors. Now this isn’t difficult to find online. However, these lights faded in and out, very gently, instead of giving of light instantaneously. And I can not find this anywhere! Does anyone know what to look for or where to find something similar? Fyi, preferably for a European outlet.</description>

      <title>Stanley bottle rusty after 1 month</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mef5uz</link>
      <description>I bought this thermos on the official stanley website and I used it just to put boiling tap water, and after 1 month, it started to get rusty at the bottom.

The warranty does not cover rust! they sent me an email giving me tips to clean it (I tried vinegar, baking soda+hot water, scrubing it with dish soap) and nothing worked

It's hilarious and frustrating at the same time that a stainless steel product gets rusty after 1 month of use.

Does anyone have any tips to clean it? I don't want to throw it away.</description>

      <title>For Those Who Experience Eye Strain or fatigue from Eink: Try Dark Mode</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1mek01w/for_those_who_experience_eye_strain_or_fatigue/</link>
      <description>If you're still getting eye strain or fatigue from eink displays I found that using dark mode actually makes it much more comfortable to look at.

This reduced the contrast strain and pattern glare I was experiencing, especially during longer reading sessions.

In windows you can enable dark mode or go into high contrast settings and set the dark version of that which seems to work well. I am still playing with colored text against the black background to see if it's any better. (Kaleido 3). I also use the invert settings shortcut on android for my carta Eink android devices which also works well.

Worth trying if regular eink still bothers your eyes. Would be curious to know if anyone else finds dark mode easier on them with Eink.

Edit: this does increase ghosting but worth it for the added relief with my visual issues.</description>

Currently I have:

Bigme Hi break pro (daily driver phone) 
Boox tab ultra c pro (for work, reading) 

I'm really enjoying both of these devices, including the limitations they bring.

I am thinking of getting an e ink monitor for my desktop. I mainly will use this for music production. I know it's not the ideal set up but I've seen that it's doable. Does anyone have an e ink monitor. What is your experience? 

Which out of the bigme, boox and Dasung would you pick?</description>

      <title>Buyer beware: BigMe HiBreak Pro screen problems</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1mea69e/buyer_beware_bigme_hibreak_pro_screen_problems/</link>
      <description>Hi all. I've had my HiBreak Pro 10 weeks, and with no warning or physical damage the screen has frozen (static image and non-resonsive). Rebooting the phone, waiting for the battery to run out, etc doesn't work, and BigMe support says it's likely broken.

Based on reports in r/bigme (e.g. [HiBreak Pro: Buy at your own risk, return if you can](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bigme/comments/1mdpzls/hibreak_pro_buy_at_your_own_risk_return_if_you_can/)) the screen issues seem to be widespread, and there is currently no good resolution. I've been speaking to support for 3 weeks, and they finally offered a replacement used device - but on the condition I ship my phone with all data on it (which can't be wiped, since the screen has broken). For me that's a non-starter, but even for those comfortable with it they warn the replacement process takes "some time", so would likely require buying another phone to fill the gap.

Alternatively they have offered 30% off a new one, but given the issues encountered during my short ownership (multiple updates requiring hard resets and hours setting up again, flaky Android Auto, disabled developer mode, strange background requests, etc) and the 10 week lifespan, I don't feel good about rolling the dice again.

Posting as fair warning for those considering a BigMe purchase, or wondering whether to hold on to theirs (if my screen still worked, I'd be selling now).  It's unfortunate, since I initially recommended the phone to multiple friends and found it great for reducing distraction, but neither BigMe nor their products can be relied on.</description>

      <title>Viwood drawing app not up to standard, should I just give up on eink?</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1meosqq/viwood_drawing_app_not_up_to_standard_should_i/</link>
      <description>Hi, I made a post about this on the Viwood sub not long ago. Essentially, I bought the Viwood expecting to be able to use it as a concept planner to replace paper/pencil - except it turns out there's no zoom or pan function in the drawing app. You're limited to one screen per page and that's it, which is pretty useless for what I wanted to do with it.

So I'm figuring I'll be returning this as I can already tell it won't work for me, but now I'm not sure if I should even bother looking at any other eink tablets.

Are there any that offer an infinite (or even large scale) canvas to work on that allow zooming and panning? Ideally I want something that I can treat almost like a white board, but obviously digitised. I was originally going to go with the Supernote, but the Viwood was around $300-400aud cheaper and the reviews I saw online prior to purchasing made it sound like they were comparable. It's only now testing out the drawing software that I realised how bad it actually is.

\*edit\* Looking a few more options, I'm wondering if I wouldn't be better off with something like the Wacom MovinkPad 11...</description>

      <title>Warning: goodereader.com and fujitsuquaderno.com are SCAMMERS !</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1me83ld/warning_goodereadercom_and_fujitsuquadernocom_are/</link>
      <description>Previous post on this topic in r/eink was deleted, because the poster was threatened with legal action from the scammers. I am not afraid of legal action.

This post is to warn everyone that goodereader.com and fujitsuquaderno.com are scam sites. They are both run by the same person: Peter Carotenuto. You can verify this by visiting [refunds page on fujitsuquaderno](https://fujitsuquaderno.com/refund_returns/) and see that it links to goodereader.com

So they are both scam sites, I almost lost 1000$ (I wanted to buy Quaderno A4 Gen3 with accessories) but after 5 weeks of waiting I started a dispute and PayPal fortunately refunded me.

Peter Carotenuto openly admitted that he is a scammer because he sent this response to paypal as the answer to the refund request: „The customer ordered an NFT, and it was delivered via Email. We feel this dispute is both unwarranted and frivolous”. He wrote that Quaderno is an NFT !

To buy Quaderno you might check out Japan Rabbit or Zen Market. There are two success stories in the recent posts:

1.	⁠⁠https://www.reddit.com/r/FujitsuQuaderno/s/qrqeKRqlk2
2.	⁠⁠https://www.reddit.com/r/FujitsuQuaderno/s/SISHoiaErx

For other eink devices see amazon, Boox and others.</description>

      <description>疯狂动物城2预告片出来了,我是很喜欢这个系列的，肯定要带孩子去看。但是预告片里这一段引爆了小红书。女拳师们就跟团建一样开始批判迪士尼让朱迪服美役。理由是兔子耳朵这么卷会很疼。


我就奇怪了，看过1都知道朱迪的耳朵就像橡皮泥一样，是可以随着心情随便改变形状的。不然连警帽都带不了。你在指责朱迪服美驿之前要不要先问问朱迪服人役这事，为什么兔子还得上班穿衣服。？



迪士尼都政治正确到什么份上了，好不容易满足了美国左派但是还是没逃过国内女拳师。哎</description>

      <title>俄国人也挺可怜的</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/China_irl/comments/1mekui1/俄国人也挺可怜的/</link>
      <description>感觉俄国人陷入了无能狂怒的阶段。怪全世界，怪北约东扩，怪美国邪恶，怪中国不帮忙，就是不想想自己为什么要侵略其他国家。大鹅搞侵略也不是一天两天一年两年了。从沙皇时代，到苏联时代，侵略没停过。当恶霸可能不道德，美国也当恶霸，但是当恶霸又打不过，这能怪谁呢。

主动入侵乌克兰，还是两次，现在打不下来。你说一千，道一万，什么北约东扩，人家乌克兰有理由为了自己国家的发展加入欧盟。说到北约东扩，瑞典芬兰也加入北约了，乌克兰还没有，人家可能只想加入欧盟。

周边一圈从波罗的海，到波兰，到高加索都是反俄先锋。目前只有中亚五国，朝鲜，中国，伊朗可能还有合作。为什么呢？全世界不喜欢老毛子，老毛子be like: 我没错，错的世界！

经济上被制裁。产业落后，被世界孤立，不知道毛子未来是什么。

国内腐败，老中过去做生意被老毛子坑的事情屡见不鲜。

一些俄国人在埋怨中国不帮俄国。据我所知，中国援助了不少战争物资，通过各种渠道，比如绕道朝鲜。这些事情都不能说，公开了就被美国制裁。

而且中国民间反俄的情绪仅次于反日吧。中国政府如果不是基于反美需要，也不太可能和俄罗斯搞在一起。

对内强制推行俄语教育，欧洲和西亚部分国土的邻国，能反的都反了。中亚五国目前夹在中俄之前，中国不转向，他们也不好动。万一中国背刺毛子一刀，中亚五国说不定也会像高加索国家一样转向反俄。
到时候靠谁呢？伊朗？被打得还不了手，几天就被打趴下了，领导层点名击杀了一圈。依靠朝鲜么？

别人讨厌俄国，就怪其他人被西方洗脑了。真巨婴，活在幻想里。

      <title>Rainbow Six Siege cheating is the worst it’s ever been and Ubisoft isn’t responding (13 total)– Case #24027387</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/1mel8zl/rainbow_six_siege_cheating_is_the_worst_its_ever/</link>
      <description>I’m beyond frustrated with Ubisoft and Rainbow Six Siege (Rainbow Six Siege X) right now.

I’ve been a loyal player for years, I’ve supported the game through operators, skins, and battle passes—easily in the thousands of money spent over the entire games life time)—and I’ve always played by the rules. But Ubisoft is failing to uphold their anti-cheat promises and ignoring escalated support tickets for weeks.

Here are the facts:

13 documented cases of blatant cheating in ranked.

Case #24027387 escalated weeks ago with screenshots and replay files – no response.

Follow-up Case #24167601 referencing the ignored escalation – still nothing.

I have a complete paper trail of every ticket and cheater reported.


Ubisoft markets Rainbow Six as a competitive, anti-cheat protected experience, but in reality:

Community data shows that roughly 10% of all matches get reported for cheating (per R6Analyst) – and that’s just the reported ones.

Content creators and pros have said this is the worst state for cheaters the game has ever been in.

Pengu commented on how bad it’s gotten.

Varsity, Fett, and YaBoyRoy have all spoken about the cheating problem.

Some pros and high-level players are now avoiding matchmaking entirely and sticking to scrims, practice, or 10-man custom lobbies.


Even escalated support tickets are ignored for weeks, leaving cheaters untouched.


I’m building a paper trail in case I need to escalate this further through BBB, FTC, or arbitration under Ubisoft’s own ToS. I’m even considering a consumer rights complaint, because this feels like a breach of Ubisoft’s implied promise to provide the fair, competitive environment they advertise and sell.

At this point, all I want is for Ubisoft to do their job:

1. Ban the cheaters I reported.


2. Acknowledge that ignoring escalated support tickets for weeks is not okay.



If anyone else has been dealing with this, keep your paper trail. This is happening far too often to be an isolated case.

Ubisoft – please respond to your paying customers.

TL;DR:
13 blatant cheaters reported.
2 escalated tickets ignored for weeks.
Ubisoft advertises anti-cheat but doesn’t enforce it.
I’m documenting everything for BBB/FTC if they don’t respond.
Ubisoft – do your job.</description>

      <description>He shouldn't even have it in the first place, it makes him too strong.

Gogo should be like Mira and only have the 1X sights.</description>

      <description>Am I wrong in thinking you should not be able to get spawnpeeked instantly without leaving spawn? I was pinging him for the team thinking he was going to hold the slit for anyone running over as I've actually never seen this spawn peek before</description>
