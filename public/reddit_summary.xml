      <description>I'm looking for a necklace in this style, but I'm unsure if Sprezzi is a good brand. Does anyone have any experience with them or recommendation for similar ones?

      <description>We are in need of a new mattress Im just wondering what brands have you had success with? Im on the hunt for a new one and every brand seems to have a bunch of "this is the best mattress ever!" reviews and a bunch of reviews saying it died after a year. I know most mattresses have a life span so they aren't truly buy it for life but what brands have lasted you guys?</description>

      <title>Best water bottle to buy</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1mcmpz6/best_water_bottle_to_buy/</link>
      <description>So I'm wanting to purchase a new water bottle. I always would buy cheap ones say like Hydrapeak ones from like TJ Maxx or Ross. 

However I'm needing a very good water bottle that will keep water cold (40oz or higher) and that it won't have these little plastic thingies that most water bottles have on the inside. The reason being it's so annoying to clean/hand wash them and they mold at times (though I do my best to wash my bottle everyday). But the other issue is I just struggle to remove the plastic/silicone and then put it back on.

My other thing is I hate straws. So a Stanley is an absolute no. (Also not a fan of the handle). 

So any suggestions for a good 40 oz (or higher) bottle that's easy to clean and keeps water cold?</description>

      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1mckl5s/requestwhat_are_some_gadgets_that_changed_your/</link>
      <description>I'm feeling like re-assessing the kinds of gadgets I'm using on a regular basis and trying to discover some things I probably haven't known about that might improve my life considerably that I'm sure this community has multiple of for various things such that having the product enables the whole hobby.  I've come here before for cooking tools recommendations and always open to more but I'm feeling like I should be able to consider more than just a smart phone and a smart watch / fitbit as a regular user.  Personally even smart watches have limits because of battery life but I wear glasses and feel like there's gotta be something affordable and simple for glasses wearers without necessarily going overboard with an augmented reality headset.  I want something that's really optimized for battery life and durability / utility and long-lasting usability that maybe does innovative things in ways others might not have thought of, like keychain tools, pens / wallets / travel gear / etc.  I love learning about cool new Every Day Carry tools and am also curious if there's also really cool gadgets for techie nerdy types too, eg I'm def the type of person who wants to go camping and play video games under the stars and be able to pack accordingly with really awesome tools that are well suited for both.</description>

      <title>üéâTwo sets of Speed Queens üéâ</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mcrf5n</link>
      <description>Our seventh baby arrives soon and the best kind of "nesting" was that my LG front loader set died two weeks ago, and we replaced it with another Speed Queen set! 

Last year we added a second w/d set to our detached converted garage workroom and I remain convinced that modern mother's laundry woes are due to 2+ hr wash cycles (a regular wash time in my LG that still left clothes dingy and soiled blankets smelly). Now we have one washer going with clothes, and another for blankets and towels. Plus two clothes lines. It's almost fun!

Hoping these will last to wash grandbaby clothes in 20 years. My dad still has the Maytag washer/dryer he and my mom bought before I was born and I'm 33.</description>

      <title>If I told younger me, "One day, you will get enthusiastic about nail clippers", he'd call me a liar. But he'd be wrong.</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1mcxlar/if_i_told_younger_me_one_day_you_will_get/</link>
      <description>I have strong nails. Like, *really* strong nails. Like, two bowls of cereal daily, super-calcium strong nails. As such, clipping them has always been a bit of pain. Someone on here said Seki nail clippers are the business, and let me tell you: they were not wrong!

I honestly never thought nail clippers could even *be* this much better than literally anything I've ever used before. They need barely any pressure and \**snip**, that MF is gone! And the build quality on them is kind of crazy. When you pick them up for the first time, open them up, give them a look and a few practice air-snips, you know you're holding something that was designed by people who give a shit. And then you use them and you're like, "Hell yes! Where have you been all my life!?"

US$18 and worth every penny. I'm very confident that these things will long outlive me.</description>

      <title>Anyone else at the point where product quality is so bad you‚Äôre contemplating making everything yourself for quality sake?</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1mcrqv8/anyone_else_at_the_point_where_product_quality_is/</link>
      <description>Things have progressively gotten worse with product quality, durability, and customer experience. I‚Äôm now at the point where I can‚Äôt even find a bastion of quality at any price point. I‚Äôm also not interested in used/thrifted stuff. 

More and more I find myself having the thought I should just make it myself so I won‚Äôt be disappointed anymore. Things are so bad I‚Äôm literally considering how I can to weld to build something I needed recently. 

I‚Äôm over here scheming how I might source high quality stainless steel, strategizing how I can hire a tailor to make jeans from the best denim made by a small batch loom machine I heard about, wondering if I could DIY rotomold plastic parts, build my own furniture, throw clay to make my own dishes.  

I‚Äôm over here having grandiose thoughts in response to the utter lack of quality. I‚Äôm a maker myself, have a 3d printer, I do basic woodworking, etc. 

Anyone else having these thoughts?</description>

      <title>Is it possible to custom order a smartphone with an eink screen</title>

      <description>Hi all

I have a lot of health issues associated with screen use, and I find most smartphones difficult to tolerate. I'd love an eink phone but I'm in the US, and most won't work with US carriers. I  was wondering if there's any way to custom order and/or modify an American smartphone to use an eink screen. My guess is probably not, but its worth asking! Let me know if any of you have looked into this and found success before.</description>

      <title>Seeking a versatile ereader/e-ink tablet</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1mck1oz/seeking_a_versatile_ereadereink_tablet/</link>
      <description>Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm in the market for an ereader/e-ink tablet and would like to hear your suggestions. My primary uses will be reading PDFs, web browsing, on-line articles, a bit of social media and some occasional note-taking (into PDFs and separate documents). The main reason I'm looking to get one is to relieve my sensitive and dry eyes from regular displays. I use my Boox Mira and Kindle PW for most other activities.

Required: Android or another open platform (to install apps), a speaker or an option to connect an external one via BT.

Nice to have: good portability, colour screen (but I'm fine to go for B/W should it be for better clarity and contrast).

I've been eyeing these two devices which seem to match my criteria the best so far but each comes with some pitfalls obviously: 

Onyx Boox Go 7 (B/W or colour) - I tried Palma 2 a few months ago and had to return it because of inconsistent screen responses and I'm afraid it may be a feature of other products too.

Viwoods AI Paper Mini - I guess this would an ideal size for me but I'm still not sure to what extent this device actually supports installing third-party apps.

Are these two recommendable or would you suggest alternatives? 

Thank you!</description>

      <title>Famue E-Ink MP3-Players (and what to be aware of)</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1mchfz9/famue_eink_mp3players_and_what_to_be_aware_of/</link>
      <description>Famue has recently released a new E-Ink mp3-player: The BF07.

The official Famue aliexpress page is called "Famue Great Potential Audio Store". But there are more official resellers of Famue products on aliexpress.

So apparently Famue has two eink-mp3 players in their product line:

1. The Famue BF01 which has a 3.5-inch screen. (This one was released somewhere last year. In the past it has been reviewed by Good E-Reader on youtube).
2. The Famue BF07 has a 2.7-inch screen and it seems that it has been released just recently (I have no idea when exactly).

PSA:  
If you just buy a random "eink mp3-player" from amazon, you will most definitely receive a fake of the BF07 . The biggest problem with the fake-famue is that the software is just horrible.

With a lot of luck it might be possible to flash the BF07 firmware from Famue on those fake devices, but I have no idea how to flash the firmware. Also I have no idea how to get access to the original firmware by Famue. Unfortunately I got a fake myself.</description>

Hey everyone. Been trying to find this specific model in the UK, but haven't had any luck so far.

      <description>I used to have an ereader and i remember it was only 8b Kindle device, it was a great device, i just eventually gotten all the use i needed from it within about a year. 

It resold locally really well. The same price which i also bought it for locally.

Im thinking now do i buy kindle locally again or do i try something new like kobo or boox secondhand?

kindle im looking at is at around 90$ locally with 32gb, or i can try to find a kobo online at much higher cost i think 130$ for 32gb</description>

      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1mcp4l2/viwoods_or_supernote/</link>
      <description>Split on these two options as a student (STEM major) and a software engineer. My main use cases are taking notes during class and creating study guides, reading textbooks and whitepapers, journaling in spanish to learn the language, and some light usage for work. I'm leaning towards the Viwoods, but I can't get a good read on which is actually a better product overall. I'm liking the development velocity of viwoods, though it seems half-baked at times. If you have both, which is better?</description>

      <title>Me searching the best E-ink phone as eye-protection</title>
      <link>https://i.redd.it/x2g2isbgnyff1.jpeg</link>
      <description>Just to have a little fun with this post here :) I think I'm done for a while. E-ink market is developing fast but it needs a few more steps. I was thinking about having an e-ink phone that has not much functions. I work on computer so I now find every second tiring my eyes on normal phone.

I like closed systems with limits while they work reliable. Light Phone III might be great option with NFC, GPS, camera, notes and nothing else - but they dropped e-ink. 

Until the time I find something that fits, I will start a new lifestyle like I already had something like that. Uninstalling apps and using my current phone as a simple phone is much cheaper for now but hard to do the first steps. So, just thinking loud...Bank transfers? Should do it in the evening on desktop. Messenger? No important messages there. Emails? Just leave me alone. Youtube? Ouch. Browser? That's really tough in my lifestyle. Have to get used to it bro'. Trying to use notes only and do the stuff on desktop in a dedicated time zone. 

We are trapped by great user experience and have to get out of it. Starting now. Cheers :)</description>

      <description>I lost internet connection for a couple minutes in the middle of a ranked match. It was quickly restored, but the game refused to let me back into the match. So I made a silly montage of my attempts to reconnect.</description>

      <title>can we get the old renown gain back for players who own the game and current one for the f2p players ?</title>
      <link>https://i.redd.it/3apcrrv3txff1.jpeg</link>
      <description>this way ubisoft get to keep the og players happy and give the f2p players an incentive to buy the game .. i know you guys are tired of seeing complaints about renown every 2 posts but the harsh nerf is so injustified .. maybe if enough players complained ubisoft would give in...it's almost impossible now to buy the event packs with renown since the collection costs 350k...it would take ages to save up for it with the current renown gain</description>

      <title>In Your Opinion... What's the Best and Worst map in Siege, and Why?</title>
      <link>https://i.redd.it/a6y7uo0rpxff1.png</link>
      <description>Pretty simple, looking to discuss.

  
I think Chalet is the best because it allows a very diverse set of playstyles that are all viable.  
I think Tower is the worst because half the map either encourages defenders to rat or is completely useless.</description>
