      <title>Range hood recs plz, all the specs, brands, and features are just overwhelming.</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1mh1x0v/range_hood_recs_plz_all_the_specs_brands_and/</link>
      <description>I'm about to move into the first home that’s truly mine. The kitchen is a big deal for our family, so I want to invest in a really decent range hood. But I have no idea where to start. There are just so many options, and I’m getting totally overwhelmed by all the specs: CFM, sones, ducted vs. ductless, filters vs. filterless... I don’t even know what actually matters when it comes to picking a good one.

And I feel like evey brand and sales keep telling me about CFM, is it really the most important thing? Am I supposed to just get the one with the highest number, like it’s a robovac's suction power or something?

If it matters, we tend to cook a lot of flavorful food, things like curries, frying, and spicy dishes, so I’m guessing the range hood will need to play a pretty important role in the kitchen. Any advice are more than appreciated!</description>

      <title>Vibrators that are BIFL? WeVibe? Lelo?</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1mggq50/vibrators_that_are_bifl_wevibe_lelo/</link>
      <description>Recently I had to replace a vibrator I had purchased on Amazon (no real brand, likely a generic from China) but it was great despite the battery truly dying after 4 years. I replaced it with a much more expensive rabbit vibrator from WeVibe, but the woman at the sex shop told me 4 years is a pretty good lifetime for a vibrator.

Anyone else have experiences with products that have lasted over a decade and hold a good charge?</description>

      <title>Cotton Women’s underwear</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1mh0oqa/cotton_womens_underwear/</link>
      <description>Does anyone have a recommendation for cotton underwear for women? I’m super picky and I’ve tried so many different brands. They have to be full coverage, cotton (with a small percentage of elastic), not paper thin, and last more than a few months. The best ones be found so far are Kindly ones from Walmart and unfortunately I think they discontinued making the specific style I liked a few years ago. I’m also nervous spending a good amount of money on underwear because I’ve never had any last very long.</description>

      <description>This beard trimmer (model BT5210) lasted me 7.5 years and originally cost me $50. Was very pleased with the performance. A couple of days ago it randomly stopped charging. I just replaced it with the new series 5000 Philips trimmer. Hoping to get a similar life expectancy out of that trimmer as well 🤞</description>

      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1mh0thy/what_winter_coat_are_yall_using/</link>
      <description>i know it’s august but i’ve been thinking about how terrible winter was on campus last year (im in upstate new york) and have been online window shopping for a new coat.

i’m just so picky though, i really hate puffer jackets and anything with that plasticity material and ideally would want something with no sherpa or fur. which seemingly rules out all coats. 

so any new coat recommendations to have a look at would be appreciated ◡̈</description>

      <title>YSK: old Reddit threads, many from this sub, are being brigaded by ad bots to skew Google and Al search results</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1mh1u9i/ysk_old_reddit_threads_many_from_this_sub_are/</link>
      <description>Why YSK: I'm sure you have also given up on Google's SEO sewage when trying to find a product that meets your needs. It's become common practice to instead try searching something like "Best Counter Top Reverse Osmosis System + Reddit" to get genuine user experience testimonials vs articles where the highest paying sponsor "magically" comes out as the best product.

Well, ad bots have figured this out, and are brigading old threads to trick Google, Al, and users into believing that X product is better than Y.


The telltale sign of this happening is when a thread is many years old, yet the top comment is from like 2 months ago. While an experienced user will be able to detect this, someone who is asking ChatGPT to “search the web for best X according to Reddit” or relying on Google’s AI Overview will 100% fall prey to this.

Want to see for yourself? Use my example above for a google search, and you'll see how every thread has been brigaded by new comments about a product called “waterdrop”


TLDR: Ad Bots are manipulating old Reddit threads. Be more vigilant when searching for products. Do not trust new comments on old posts.</description>

      <title>Viwoods AI Paper versus Boox Note Max</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1mgkfl9/viwoods_ai_paper_versus_boox_note_max/</link>
      <description>Hi All!

  
I am looking for some help in deciding which eink tablet I should go with, and have narrowed my decision down between the AI Paper and the Note Max. My use case is:

* Reading eBooks and PDFs in bed with a side table light
* Readings news from The Economist, The Financial Times, and HBR
* Continuous learning from PDF textbooks -- and taking notes as I learn (or complete example problems)
* Continuous learning of new languages (Italian, Korean)
* General life organization (calendars, to-do lists, journaling, etc...)

  
For those who have these devices:

* Is the Note Max:
   * Too big to use as an e-reader?
   * Too fragile? I read some concerns about broken screens
   * Too glass-like for a comfortable writing experience?
* Is the AI Paper:
   * Too small for reading and annotating PDFs?
   * Too underpowered for news apps?

Thanks for your help!</description>

      <title>selling my Mobiscribe Wave, ideally to someone outside the US</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1mgt5xw/selling_my_mobiscribe_wave_ideally_to_someone/</link>
      <description>$80 + whatever shipping turns out to be will almost certainly be much, much less than whatever you would pay for it in your country, since for whatever reason there seem to be insane tariffs on everyone outside the US buying these from the OEM. I want to sell this to someone outside the US because we always suggest it in this sub and it's always like "it would cost me $400 to import :("

as a reminder, this is an 8" waterproof(!!) Android 12 e-reader/e-writer device with a Mobius(!) screen, an Allwinner B810 quad-core CPU, 4GB RAM and Play Store compatibility. understand: this is no speed demon! the Wave is a budget device and it performs that way. however, that doesn't mean it's not capable. especially the notes application is surprisingly powerful -- it has surprisingly good handwriting recognition and is fairly feature-complete. it's also great as an e-reader. it's Android application compatibility is hit-and-miss -- Outlook simply won't start, for example, and it's not great at adjusting its refresh rates to accommodate applications that need faster refresh. but for $89 from their store it's also absolutely impossible to beat. unfortunately they won't be making any more and seem to be going out of business. but until then you can get yourself something at an absolute bargain-basement price.

Is it good enough for mom things (Basic games, web browsing, checking emails)? What are some recommendations? I’d like one that has a good screen and backlight while also being fast enough to use comfortably when doing other things than reading and also not being overly expensive.</description>

      <title>Best B&amp;W E-ink drawing tablet</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1mgzwku/best_bw_eink_drawing_tablet/</link>
      <description>I'm looking to get my sister a B&amp;W e-ink tablet that she will use for drawing, and maybe some reading. A lot of the reviews I see about e-ink drawing tablets are about color tablets, and while she's not exactly opposed to it, she has other devices she would rather use for color drawing. As far as tablets go, right now I am thinking the BOOX Note Air 4c because she can get whatever Android apps she wants.

Does anyone have a preferred B&amp;W BOOX (or other tablet) they love for drawing?</description>

      <title>Best tablet for me? (Mostly note-taking)</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1mh5mcl/best_tablet_for_me_mostly_notetaking/</link>
      <description>Hi all. As a school psych I take a lot of notes. I take notes as I'm looking through student files, conducting observations, sitting in meetings, etc. I'm looking for an e ink tablet that could replace my legal pads. I prefer to not have to keep track of pieces of paper (kind of becomes a confidentiality issue). I need it to have the ability to index/organize my notes and export to Google Drive. If not Google Drive then some easy alternative way to sync it with my work laptop so I can the upload things to Google Drive.

I don't need to do much reading on the tablet, so I don't really care about that part of things. Bonus points for one with expandable memory.

What would you all recommend?

Thanks in advance.</description>

      <description>最近看“如来佛”朱龙广去世想到，老西游记电视剧可以说把好多神仙的形象在人民心目中完全定型了。
神奇的是，朱龙广，左大玢（观音菩萨）等演员其实完全是在毛泽东体系下成长并培养的演员，朱龙广是军教片地道战男主，左大玢更是得到毛泽东亲自接见的戏曲演员。
现在的演员却再也出不了能将神仙形象定型的人了</description>

      <description>我很好奇，一个成年人，都上大学了，连这点为自己辩护的观念都没有吗？

还是说因为这件事涉及到“性”，所以保持了这中国一贯的“谈性色变”的传统，因为羞耻感，不好意思在公众媒体谈论这件事，害怕被误解？

我无法想象一个人成长到这个年纪了，点最基本的自我意识都没有，最后还要爹妈出面，甚至网友出面帮忙争取舆论优势，所以现在全中国男人都成为这个人的爹妈了？

---

至少我个人觉得这件事情的真相只有当事人一个人最清楚。事实的真相要么是“万一他确实被误解了呢”，要么是“万一他做贼心虚呢”，只看他怎么诚实的面对自己了。

这归根到底这是他个人的课题，我不觉得每个人都会遇到他这种情况，以及就算真的遇到了，难道你们都觉得向他一样“认怂”，然后让父母社会来收场？全中国男人要是都到了这种境地，我看这国家也就那样了。</description>

      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/China_irl/comments/1mh2x9g/忽然想到武汉大学事件会不会成为公民政治的分水岭呢/</link>
      <description>看着流出来的70万人的豆瓣生活组的各种反击的教程，发现女拳师不但把互联网玩明白了，也把中国的政治生态玩明白了。现在基本就是按闹分配，谁声音大谁有道理。所以组织起来的10%可以轻易压制一盘散沙的90%。，甚至让公权力作出让步。这个豆瓣生活组不就是政党的雏形吗？它基本具有一切政党的特征了，虽然很恶劣但是再恶劣的政党也是政党呀。而且政府对于女拳师的结社一般是非常宽容的，不像男的有点苗头就打掉了。



看从前天晚上开始铺天盖地的对肖的诋毁和各种小作文，就是一个时间段后集体爆发的。欧美不知道有没有类似事件，但是大家都能看到的最近的不就是台湾的大罢免吗？女拳师和青鸟是不是让人看了似曾相识？就是海量谣言，不给你解释的机会外加身份政治。你说豆瓣生活组变异吧，似乎也没比德国另类选择党，日本参政党或者美国MAGA更离谱。如果反贼心心念念的公民社会被女拳师搞成了这是不是成了黑色幽默了？



大家可以畅想一下这个未来。</description>

      <description>首先要明白，这些谣言在2023年底这件事最开始以性骚扰的定性上热搜的时候就已经炒过一次，当时肖同学母亲就已经辟谣过了。

1. 肖同学的恐男“室友”

      <title>今天终于吧哪吒2看了</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/China_irl/comments/1mh5wqx/今天终于吧哪吒2看了/</link>
      <description>结论就是除了画质真的是一坨大便。整部电影充斥着屎尿屁和各种低级笑料，而且很多笑点都是生搬硬套上去的。比如哪吒迷路上厕所尿到了饮料里这段真的浪费了大量的电影时间，而且你这种东西来一次就差不多了，这种低级笑话甚至覆盖了整个电影。还有那句“我活不活无所谓，我只要你死”，听得我一阵尴尬，完全出戏。这种台词和桥段，真的会有人觉得好笑或热血吗？我知道有人会说这是合家欢电影，是拍给小朋友看的。可问题是，迪士尼也是合家欢啊，你可以说他剧情无聊政治正确，人家至少不会让我看得尴尬。

哪吒这部真的就像是导演自己都没想拍好，只想着怎么搞笑、怎么热闹，把低级笑话一股脑塞进来，节奏也全被打乱。剧情基本是标准的低龄向热血套路，但我是完全热血不起来。片中的煽情部分也让人尴尬到摇头，比如哪吒他妈死的时候的回忆杀，前面没铺垫没感情，突然来一段催泪戏，我真不知道该用什么去共情。而且两夫妻跑路的时候，底下的老百姓完全没人管… 打架的时候也是，打龙王变身后龙王自己记不起暗号的那一段，我甚至觉得导演把观众当白痴了。 总之，这片子给我的感觉就是导演根本没打算拍一部好看的电影，而是拍了一个专门讨好低龄观众的爆米花爽片，这片子可以说就是给国内的熊孩子量身打造的，但如果你成年观众要是看完真觉得好看，那我觉得你审美水平真太low。

连这种电影都可以在国内爆火，仔细想想真的挺可怕的。</description>

      <title>This Game Is Dead!</title>
      <link>https://i.redd.it/hbhhmu8gisgf1.jpeg</link>
      <description>I don't know if it's just me, but since I got Emerald, every match there is always someone using Xim/Cronus, either on my team or on the opposite team.

It's a really annoying situation right now. I'm dying every time to people who use the SMG12 without recoil and it's starting to really bother me.

I love playing Ranked, I enjoy the competition but this game is starting to die</description>

      <title>The Elephant.</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/1mh7syp/the_elephant/</link>
      <description>This is beyond anything I’ve imagined for this game. It’s absolutely ridiculous, sad, and unforgivable. How in the world this company can continue to hold their heads without feeling shame is unbelievable to me. 

This game has been DESTROYED by cheaters. I’ve seen it all. Keyboard and mouse on console, basic walls, flying, booted offline, elo trapping. It’s INSANE. If you ever wanted to be good at this game, you should be grateful you’re not, and have a good excuse to give up. Because it’s NOT worth it, It only gets worse the higher you go. 

I’d make an argument (with an ass-pull guess based off experience) that at least 30% of this player base has cheated at least once. And I’m not exaggerating in the slightest. I wouldn’t be shocked if there are still currently ‘semi-pros’ who are hiding it. 

The only way to play this game properly is within scrims and face-it. Otherwise it is a complete JOKE. We all know it’s happening constantly, yet nothing ever changes. I understand this is nothing new for all competitive games. But it REALLY leaks on this game in particular. At least in CS you can play 5 games and only face 1 waller. In this one you can’t go 1!</description>

      <title>i hate how the concept of Blackbeard is that if you dont have the 100% headshot accuracy EVERYTIME you face him you are dead</title>
      <link>https://v.redd.it/ac4ye92bbvgf1</link>
      <description>yes my crosshair placement and aim was off .. im not talking specifically about this clip .. but a player shouldn't get punished for missing the head hitbox for a second .. this is a flawed design and shouldn't even be considered to be put in this game .. plus his gun hits super hard with no recoil and an acog  .. you might say its skill issue but thats my whole point .. why would you design something that punishes the lesser skilled players who cant score headshots every single time ? the old blackbeard paper shield design was way more balanced</description>
