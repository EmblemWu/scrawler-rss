      <title>Any products you swear by that are surprisingly low maintenance?</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1m7aynv/any_products_you_swear_by_that_are_surprisingly/</link>
      <description>My stainless steel French press is one item that I constantly recommend to others. Honestly, it is the easiest coffee maker I have ever owned, and I’ve had it for approximately seven years. It is essentially indestructible and does not require any replacement filters or electronics. I simply clean it off and give the mesh filter a weekly scrub, and it's ready to use. The simplicity of the design is kind of lovely. 

When I was searching for a spare to carry at work, I actually came across a design that looked comparable on Alibaba. I mean, tons of them. Nevertheless, even the most expensive models don't feel as sturdy or heavy as the build quality of my original one.

It helped me realize that low maintenance is more about how well something is manufactured than it is about the brand or price. Not a single moving part. No power cables. Just clever design and sturdy metal. What is your "set it and forget it" item, may I ask? That one item you use frequently but hardly ever have time to maintain, repair, or consider? Those items, in my opinion, are the things that we should all recommend more frequently.</description>

      <title>Help build a public list of the best products people actually use and trust</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1m7tkyi/help_build_a_public_list_of_the_best_products/</link>
      <description>I'm building a free open-source database of the best stuff people actually use. Not sponsored junk, not review-botted garbage. Real products that last, can be fixed, and are actually worth buying.

You can submit anything you've personally used and trust. Tools, appliances, clothes, shoes, bags, kitchen gear, anything.

Submit using the link, no signup, just drop the product: [https://tally.so/r/wbQVEe](https://tally.so/r/wbQVEe)

Volunteers (including me) are sorting everything on the backend before launch. We're trying to collect at least 1,000 good submissions before the public site goes live so it's actually useful from day one.

Upvote this if you're tired of garbage ads and fake reviews. Every real product added helps.

Thanks.</description>

      <title>Semi-large wallet that doesn't suck</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m7t6rg</link>
      <description>I've had this wallet for a mere month and it's falling apart. Lots of the stitches are coming undone, faux leather is flaking like crazy. I'm really upset. This is my second loungefly wallet and I'm extremely disappointed. I originally had a pikachu one, same build but no strap and it has been with me since high school. Eevee however isn't nearly as good. I really like the setup of this wallet. It holds the surplus of gift cards, my cash, and my change. I really like it but I fear eevee's days may be numbered, so I want to look into a potential replacement. Any suggestions? (Bonus points if it has a cute or silly design but not a requirement)</description>

      <title>What’s your oldest functioning appliance?</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1m79ohf/whats_your_oldest_functioning_appliance/</link>
      <description>Since I was in elementary school, my parents have owned the same microwave. Somehow, this awkward silver device from the early 2000s, which has a dial in place of buttons, is still in use today (it has been repaired a few times though). It doesn't have a digital display or beep, but it heats food perfectly. Three moves, innumerable power surges, and a few near-death spills haven't destroyed that thing. 

Out of nostalgia, I recently became curious and attempted to research it online. You know, to find out if anyone was still producing analog-style versions. I even looked on Alibaba. Although I couldn't find the exact one, I did find several strange off-brand copies that appeared to have been transported back in time to 1998.

I sometimes believe that modern appliances are simply not as durable as their predecessors. Although it's nice that everything is touchscreen and software-driven these days, I kind of miss the days when machines were just machines. Which appliance is the oldest one still in use in your house? Something that ought to have died by now but won't? Sincerely, I want to know if anyone is still using a blender from the 1980s or something.</description>

      <title>What’s one item you inherited that still works like a charm?</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1m7akxp/whats_one_item_you_inherited_that_still_works/</link>
      <description>A few years ago, my dad gave me his old mechanical watch, a sturdy, mid-range Seiko that he had purchased in the 1980s. It was nothing fancy. Although it's not very valuable, it nonetheless keeps excellent time, and its mechanical design further heightens its allure. All I have to do is wind it up and it does its thing. I don't even have to put batteries in it. Even though it is not exactly pretty, I love the watch.



I thought I could find something as odd yet reliable as the watch online. So I searched the internet for the same model out of curiosity. Sadly, I didn't see any that quite matched the weight and feel of the original, despite finding a few copies on Alibaba and some vintage postings elsewhere. Some things just age better than others I guess.



It serves as a reminder that things can be made to last and look good at the same time, even though I don't wear them every day. What is something you've kept or inherited that still looks new or is in perfect condition? It could be a piece of furniture, an appliance, or even a tool. I'd love to know the long-lasting items you have that come with interesting backstories.</description>

      <title>Sebago Docksides: 4 years of use vs brand new</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m7cjf5</link>
      <description>As you probably already know, Sebago's boat shoes are very durable and show great BIFL potential. Here is a comparison between a pair I have had since late 2021 and a new pair I just bought. The used pair looks almost brand new and after a painful break-in process (I am dreading it now that I have to go through it again...), they are very comfortable. True, I use cedar shoe trees and condition the leather very often, but if you take care of them, you probably can wear these shoes for a decade or two!</description>

      <title>Linen pieces that are breathable but not shapeless</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1m7t080/linen_pieces_that_are_breathable_but_not_shapeless/</link>
      <description>I’ve been slowly switching to natural fabrics for summer, mostly linen and cotton. because I just can’t deal with synthetic stuff anymore. It never breathes well and always ends up feeling kind of gross on hot days.

I’m looking for pieces that are soft, hold up after washing, and feel a bit more intentional in design. A lot of linen clothes I’ve tried are either super stiff or way too boxy. like I love Muji but some cuts are just too shapeless on me.

I recently got a dress from a small brand called lintico and it was actually softer than expected, with nice structure. That kind of balance is what I’m after, simple but still polished. Would love to hear your go-to linen brands, especially if they’re small or focus on quality. Not looking to buy a ton, just a few pieces that actually last and feel good to wear.

Thanks in advance!</description>

      <title>What’s something you’d spend more on now just to never worry about it again?</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1m7evbr/whats_something_youd_spend_more_on_now_just_to/</link>
      <description>To be honest? Kitchen knives. I used to skimp on those, buying a set for about $20, using them until they became boring, and then doing it again. After a while, I decided to buy a single, top-notch chef's knife since I was sick of cutting tomatoes like logs. Six years have passed since then. I've never looked back, and I'm still solid and sharp. The crazy thing is that I once saw a complete set of 20 knives on Alibaba for about $40. Although it appeared lovely in the pictures, I'm fairly certain the steel was softer than butter. It served as a reminder that something doesn't necessarily last just because it looks nice or is reasonably priced. 

It’s not just about cost. It’s about use, feel, and how long it holds up under harsh conditions. Good gear can actually make you enjoy the task more. That one knife made me want to cook more. It gave me joy. 

These days, even if it costs more up front, I'm much more into the idea of purchasing one excellent version of something and using it for the rest of my life. Reduced clutter, fewer things, and easier replacement. Which is the one category where you've decided to "buy it once"? Shoes? Instruments? Furniture? I really want to know what people think are long-term investments worth making.</description>

      <title>Why so expensive?</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1m73geo/why_so_expensive/</link>
      <description>I'm looking to replace a lot of my current tech with e ink. So far I have:

Phone- Big me Hibreak Pro 
Tablet- Boox ultra Pro Tab C 

I wanted to get an e ink monitor for my desktop. When I've looked into it, the only real options are the Dasung colour e ink monitor,  the Boox Mira Pro, or the Bigme B251. 

Why are these monitors so expensive? 

As im probably going to be spending a lot of money I want to make sure I pick the best one. Out of these options, which would you go for? 

Also, if anyone has any cheaper alternative suggestions, that would be amazing!</description>

      <title>Suggestions For Noob</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1m754jx/suggestions_for_noob/</link>
      <description>Heya! I've just heard about e ink tablets and honestly it sounds right up my alley. 

I'm a writer, so I take a lot of notes. I also love to read, and do some illustrating. I usually have to cart around a notebook, a sketch pad and pencil, and whateber I'm reading atm when I leave the house. As I understand it, an e ink tablet is essentially all 3 in one device.

So I'm considering getting one but I don't know where I should start looking. I'd like whatever model I get to have a colour screen and a stylus that as closely as possible mimics drawing with a pencil or marker.

Any suggestions? Or can someone tell me what specs I should look for?</description>

      <title>Eink in academics</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1m73a90/eink_in_academics/</link>
      <description>Hi there,
I would like to hear your thoughts about using eink devices in academics, especially in humanistic sciences. I've been obsessively following all the reviews on YouTube for a long time now and I've narrowed down my choices to the Viwoods Ai Paper, Supernote Manta and Boox Note Max. Doing linguistic fieldwork is one of the main aspects of my research, so I prefer the mobius screen technology that the Viwoods and Supernote have. On the other hand, the Note Max offers quite a bit more estate with its 13.3 inch screen. I can't decide, so I'd like to hear your experiences using these devices in academics. Thanks!</description>

      <title>Eink smartphones and children</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1m7ir1n/eink_smartphones_and_children/</link>
      <description>Hi!

I'm a mom of a 9 month old curious boy and I'm questioning my phone usage. It's becoming more and more stimulating for him and he keeps trying to grab it. It made me reflect on my own habits and addiction, and so I'm thinking about dumbing down my phone to 1. reduce my own usage and 2. (most importantly) limit the interest of my baby towards these devices and their well proven nefarious effects to children developpment.

Switching to a dumphone seems really intimidating at the moment, but if I must I would do it for his sake.

A eink smartphone seems to me like a good middleground - keeping maps, music, messenger, etc but with a less enticing screen and bad videos. 

My question is the following : to any of you who with child that has made the switch to an eink smartphone, what have been the effects on them? Are they less interested in these devices? Less likely to become "zombified" looking at them, and wanting more?

I know I can limit my child, but would also like to set the example and reduce the temptation at home if possible.

Thank you!!</description>

The Carta 1200 screen on my 2024 version is noticeably better than the Kindle Oasis 3, Boox Leaf 3, and even comparable to the Kobo Libra 2.  
The 2025 version now features a Carta 1300 screen, which truly surprised me with its improvement.</description>

      <title>Eink and (e-paper) Nextpaper by TCL</title>
      <link>https://i.redd.it/a7k041bvvqef1.jpeg</link>
      <description>I’m a few years into eink. Started with Kindle Scribe then SN Nomad, Kobo Libra Colour, and SN Manta. 

My use case was to decrease eye fatigue and doom scrolling, bonus would be almost dumbphone level of distraction-free use. 

In between I had a Bigme Hibreak Pro that I sold after 2 months of owning but barely any use. I had been excited for HBP but after accidentally leaving it at home for a long trip, I couldn’t find a purpose for it and the honeymoon period patience for the ghosting and refresh rates wore out on top of the software issues. Yet my search for eink phone that would protect my eyesight and also mitigate the effects of my bedtime reading continued. Then I saw TCL Nextpaper 50, but sadly didn’t see it being sold in the US. Last week I saw TCL 60 Nextpaper XE phone and I think this has now solved my issues with ghosting. 

Except for the SN Manta, I have not been this impressed with a eink or epaper(?) device in a while and I’m so happy. Considered Boox Palma 2, but glad I saw this (cheaper) TCL phone and love that I can go color as I need and also full black and white and No distraction mode. 

If there’s anyone out there who still needs a fully functioning eink phone, sometimes needs color and also does away with distractions, I think the TCL 60 nextpaper is a good answer. 🤞🏽that this is durable too. (Photo taken with 5% brightness of TCL screen)</description>

      <title>喜欢的女孩子润去德国了，心里好失落</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/China_irl/comments/1m74q2b/喜欢的女孩子润去德国了心里好失落/</link>
      <description>2年前刚来上班的一个小女孩，刚毕业，个子小小的，戴眼镜，扎个大马尾，胸平得像办公桌，从不化妆，整天穿牛仔裤，踢个洞洞鞋。

不漂亮，但是爱笑，笑起来特好看。

共事久了，发现她的魅力了。

一、爱笑，见谁都傻乎乎地笑。

二、靠谱，交给她的事情都会尽力做，同期的两个小男孩，交的事情要么不做，要么给你埋雷。

三、不埋怨，那两小子经常把活摊给她 ： “领导说你做得好啊\~\~”，她都乐呵乐呵接过来。我看不过眼说两句，她还傻笑“没事没事，我来我来”，然后晚上加班干。

没多久前听到她要去德国，挺震惊的。

于是组了个饭局，欢送她，为了避嫌，把同组的都请上了，包括那两个我讨厌得要死的小子。结果欢送宴吵吵闹闹，一句话没说上。

后来她办了离职手续，每天看着那个空落落的工位，心里空空的。

昨天晚上加班，小办公室剩下我一个人，有人推门进来。

是她。

“你还没走啊？”我有点惊讶。

“今晚半夜出发，回来拿点东西。”她又笑了，笑得真好看，然后去空位收拾东西。

“你换发型了啊？”我发现她变了点，马尾放下来了，长发披肩，还穿了个短T恤，肩膀一动就露出平坦的白肚皮。

“是啊！我又不会德语，去到那边，没办法跟师傅交流，把我剪难看了怎么办？”她笑着说。

“你不会德语？”

“不会啊，工作那么忙，哪有时间学？”她又笑了。

“那你一个人跑那么远，语言又不通，你不害怕啊？”

“不害怕啊，有翻译软件。”

“不怕遇上坏人？”

“还好吧？工作前我也怕遇上坏人啊，结果遇上你这么好的领导，罩了我两年。说不定那边人更好呢。”她又傻乎乎地笑，好像这两年的加班都不是事。

“那领导，我走啦。”她拿着杂物，向我摆摆手。

“再见，健康顺利哈。”

“这次是真的拜拜咯。”她笑着带上门。

门碰的一声关上，她永远走出了我的生活。

办公室重回死寂。我看看窗外，黑呼呼的天上，不时有飞机的光点划过。

我回头看着她空荡荡的工位，发觉自己有点失落。

我翻出手机，发现一张她的照片都没有。

我翻出聊天记录，发现全是工作对话，一条私人对话都没有。

怎么回事呢？我以为自己对女人早就无感了。

我的生活稀烂，工作稀烂，心里像一摊马桶里的死水，再漂亮的女人看着都像一团会说话的大麻烦。

我想了会，明白了。

吸引我的，不是她的外貌。

是生命力。

那种熊熊燃烧着的，无法掩盖的青春生命力。

她年轻，她还有希望，她还有未来。

我看天，看到乌云。她看天，她会看到天的另外一头，有更好的人，更好的未来在等着她。

而我已经活在我的未来里了。

这里没有快乐，没有希望，没有爱。

这里什么都没有。

难怪我喜欢她的笑容，那是她的内心渗漏出来的生命力。

她是枝头上的嫩芽，还有整个春天在等着她。

而我的春天已经过了，我是地上的枯枝，就等着一点点烂进土里。

青春易逝，容颜易老。

有一天她也会老，她的笑容也会消失，她甚至可能会变成我一样的行尸走肉。

但是啊但是。


Edit：

继续自我剖析，突然想通了。

我不爱她，我不爱任何人，我只爱我自己。

年少的爱是性欲。

年老的爱是对生的留恋和对死亡的恐惧。

Edit2：

没想这么多回复，这就是我喜欢本sub的原因啊~  

能看到国人最真实，最赤裸的恶意。

对少数的善意，感谢啦~</description>

      <title>李承鹏最新文章：杭州的粪水和《时间捡屎》</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/China_irl/comments/1m7lf2e/李承鹏最新文章杭州的粪水和时间捡屎/</link>
      <description>我看那么惨烈的《墓碑》，有时也会被一些情节给整笑。大饥荒那会儿，树皮都被啃光，甘肃通渭村的张大发饿得不行，灵光一闪跑到村外捡了冻硬的粪，回家烤着吃。通渭村另一位妇女对此很不屑，她是懂营养学的，要在边上等干部解完手，才冲过去拾粪吃。原因很简单：干部拉的屎粮食没消化完，营养高，更顶事。

但干部的屎是有限的，静宁县一位老人就夸还是他家三娘脑子好使：“三娘在门口等着队长倒小孩拉的屎，队长家小孩吃得肯定营养咧，她捡拾了屎回家，晒干再吃。”

看着看着就哭了，哭着哭着就笑了。论科学吃屎的精神。

我把《墓碑》当成灾难史，也当成忍耐史，饿死千万人没见什么反抗，倒琢磨出怎么科学吃屎。当然这是时代所逼，但好玩的是，不少饿得落下病根的老人至今还教育年轻人“你们就该过过苦日子，才能珍惜眼下的好”。吃屎教育的那抹余蕴入骨入魂，忍不住给下一代的食粮抹上精神老干妈。

前几天杭州余杭142万人集体吃屎，说是水务公司把排污管道接到饮用水管道，自来水滚滚流出都是屎黄色，做的饭菜满屋子屎味。人们上街疯抢矿泉水，还编些“直把杭州当汴州”“谈恋爱，这半年千万别跟杭州人亲嘴”“吃屎都走表了”的段子。

有上海朋友骂杭州人为什么不上街抗议，我传去当初上海宁编的段子：“这不叫挨饿，叫轻断食”“抢不到菜，就吃绿化带，增强肠道纤维”“排队核酸也讲究妆容，别人是做核酸，阿拉是走T台”“只要心里有沙，哪里都是马尔代夫”……我问他为什么不反抗。他就把我拉黑了。这些年，大家几乎只是用段子对抗生活不幸，君莫劝，劝急了，劈头盖脸招来一拨“有种你他妈去反抗啊”。

别劝小姐从良，别劝我族反抗，与其反抗，不如继续吃屎。这是真理。

我不会批评杭州人不反抗，因为吃屎源远流长。《资治通鉴》记载：从东晋、南北朝到隋唐，天灾战争不断，人民吃完草根树皮，就开始争食“粪渣”。很官方的《清世祖实录》记载：三河四省一带的人们常刮地皮找粪吃，被称作“食秽民”。《太平天国纪实》记载：安徽、江苏一带，“饥者拾牛粪中粟壳，若获人粪中糠滓，视为珍味”。吃牛粪是日常，捡到人粪的糠滓，简直是米其林。

我悲哀地想，能活下来的，大概率都吃过屎，我们是屎者的后代。

还是来点批判现实主义吧，杭州官方辟谣说“这是水源地藻类厌氧降解产生的硫醚类物质”，也有“政府爱好者”热心论证排污和饮用水管道压力和口径不一样，不可能是屎！但2013年杭州市民就发现自来水有异味，原因是大型农药厂和化工厂向钱塘江排放数万吨废液。2020年，杭州市民又发现自来水奇臭，原因是一家国企将厨余垃圾排入溪水，经抗议，该企业悄悄将污水并入市政自来水管道。上述奇葩事均由光明网多家官媒报道。疑点太多了，为什么水龙头滤芯上会有金针茹、玉米粒。为什么早在5月，取水口粪大肠菌群数值远超4月730倍，六月更升至16000个/L达到IV类水平，不能饮用甚至不能当作景观用水。从科学角度，藻类厌氧降解会产生硫醚类物质，但不能产生大肠杆菌，反倒是肠道内微生物会分解出硫醚类物质。而杭州在2020年就对污水与自来水管道进行一体化工程，污水管道其实也加压，若管理失误，就可能形成合龙倒灌……

你脑子此时肯定激凌了一下。

别激凌，你得机灵，机灵地知道只要你质疑祖国发生的一些不公平事，就是行走的1540，收了美国钱。十几年前看来很正常的批评，现在都被爱国粉红视作卖国，也对，出来卖的，见谁都像收了钱。这就尴尬了，你本想让同胞过得体面些，但有的同胞必会让你不体面，慢慢的你就不想再提“反抗”，一方面帽子叔叔会找你喝茶，另一方面，你单相思认为人民缺什么就该补什么，但这等于在阿Q面前提癞疤，有的同胞立马不干了，“别他妈吃人血馒头，你行你上”……这么多年，终于凝练出一个最优选：大家一起忍。毕竟丈母娘们常说“别人能忍，我们也能忍”，否则怎么可能诞生宇宙丈母娘之最爱的鸡汤王，董宇辉。

想想前段时间那列停运的火车，上千人闷在39度高温的铁皮罐里，还不如运猪猡的23度室温标准，大家几乎休克却没一个站出来反抗，面无表情默念《心经》：别人能忍，我也能忍，如是我闻……直到一个黑衣青年哐地把窗砸碎。当帽子叔叔把带走青年，也没一个敢阻止。呼吸了新鲜空气的人们只是暗自庆幸，好险，幸好不是我。

那些天天喊打美国炸日本武统台湾的战狼一个也没站出来，99.9%在生活中不敢砸窗的人却在网上批评车上99.9%的人不敢砸窗。我们唯一的勇气来自于：我们当时并不在火车上。

不过是《时间捡屎》历史长河中的一滴粪水罢了，杭州人民可以对标老乡勾践，他吧叽嘴说“这味儿，纯，大王病马上好”，主打的就是一个懂事。吃屎不可怕，可怕的是没吃出心态，这又是一个真理：心态不好，那才是吃屎，心态好，那叫卧薪尝胆。

你这样想就对了，再干净的水，喝下去也会化为粪水，浸入大地升腾为水汽，再降落江河湖海，又变成干净的水，然后你再喝……杭州城市宣传片《杭州不仅是一首诗》里有句台词一语成谶：“一滴水的轮回，也是一座城的蓬勃”——所以，你不要认为自己喝了粪水，这只是一滴水的轮回。

这样说显得有些消极，可是积极应该是双方面的。在杭州家长群，没有一个人为天水孩子血铅说话。天水血铅孩子的家长，也闭口不提自来水管。网上总有孤勇者呐喊“没有人是一座孤岛”，这令人敬佩，但当前中国社会的主要矛盾是：每个人希望自己遭遇不公时有人声援，但大多数人在别人遭遇不公时都假装看不见。兰州吃苯，陇南吃锑，岳阳吃砷，广西吃镉，陕西吃锌，山西吃氨氮，北京吃锂，湖南吃镉……不仅是一座座孤岛，简直是一个个互相隔绝的胶囊。当然乐观地看，孤勇者呐喊也不是完全没用，至少今后你会发现，家长们在超市里会认真凝视小食品包装上的产地，他们在领导要求下已不敢发朋友圈了，但他们会从朋友圈机敏发现，粪水最浓那几天，余杭食品加工厂没有停工。

也别说什么塔西佗效应了，弄得就跟政府做了好事只是被刁民习惯性冤枉似的。

想起有部根据真实案件改编的美国电影，《永不妥协》。朱莉娅·罗伯茨主演一名离婚后独自抚养三个孩子的单亲妈妈。生活潦倒的她是律所档案员，有一天处理地产案件文件时发现了可疑的医疗费用记录，经调查，小镇居民的饮用水被大型电力公司PG&amp;E的致癌物“六价铬”（这名字熟悉吧，对，天水）污染，该公司隐瞒真相将其篡改为安全的“三价铬”，只为受害者支付极低廉的医疗费。

她愤怒了，她没有背景也没有法律学位，拖着三个孩子、顶着烈日，一户户走访小镇居民，收集六价铬导致癌症的线索。期间她也遭受白眼，仍靠坚韧不拔和精神力获得信任，收集证据，成功号召几百名居民发起对PG&amp;E历史性的诉讼。

PG&amp;E派出强大的律师团，高傲地质问她：“你凭什么自认为了解这些人？”

她说：“我花了18个月深入资料和居民的生活。我对这个案子的了解远超过你，这324个人的名字，我一个也没忘。”

她开始朗读：“Donna Jensen，Pamela Duncan，Ronald and Annabelle，Plummer……”，她一个一个说出全部受害者的全名，整个法庭寂静无声，这段背出所有人名字的情节，是她的高光时刻。正义不是抽象的制度，而是对每一个人的尊重。

她最终帮居民赢得高达3.33亿美元的赔偿金。胜诉的瞬间，人们哭泣着冲上来与她拥抱，她说：“你们的名字被听到了”。

奥斯卡给朱莉娅·罗伯茨送上金奖，影评人说：它表达了“一人能为万众发声”的强烈信念。

但在我们这里，她没机会念出那324个受害者名字，穿着暴露且离异的她会被质疑作风有问题，是小三，她没有学历，根本没资格上庭，她这么执着，一定有境外势力操纵，而伤她最深的很可能是她为之拼搏的居民。别不信，因家境贫穷每天只吃馒头和少量咸菜的吴花燕，瘦得只有21公斤，为了帮助她，一名老师向国际组织求援，吴花燕就说：“你让中国人在国际上丢脸了，中国人的事情自己能解决，不要让外国人抹黑中国”。

前两天刷到一个博主（名字忘了）写的一句令人触动的话：“社会普遍性下作，年青人整体性懦弱”。一方面衙门干了许多不堪的事，另一方面，民众困在列车里不敢砸窗，天天测日本核辐射但没一个敢去测杭州、天水，吃了屎却不敢往水务公司门口泼粪，却集体往一个跟外国人上床的女生身上泼粪，还上升到国格。奇怪，黛安娜与埃及富豪搞破鞋，没伤到英国国格，王昭君嫁了三代匈奴单于，没伤到大汉朝格，当代女大学生约个炮，就伤到国格？更奇怪是，他们刷到文革时女孩多谈几个男友就被枪毙，也大骂时代荒诞，可现实生活中他们仍玩沉塘那一套，恨不得连夜把女孩裹上麻袋扔大连老虎滩海里。文革一直没走，贫富差距体现在性资源差距，就是晚清大革命时期的阿Q，“妈妈的，和尚摸得，老子摸不得吗。”

这么鸡零狗碎的时代，宏大叙事是可耻的，老年人在入党，中年人在念心经，年轻人在躺平，粉红在抓破鞋和汉奸，富豪在养小三，子女在争产财……而穷人在为基建欢欣鼓舞，看看热搜，多少拧锣丝的人在下面跟帖点赞，“雅江水电站建成后，能发3000亿度电，相当于三个三峡水电站，国之重器，硬控阿三，生于华夏，无怨无悔”，然后他们就去商场乘凉了，家里开空调太不划算，电，又他妈涨价了。

总有人在我文章下面留言，说你不要泼冷水啊，中国人并不怂，举出黄花岗、五四运动、还有一些敏感词例子。还有文盲杠精来杠，你他妈瞎吗，看不到那么多次农民起义。是啊，我族从不缺反抗者，但中国史的规律是：反抗失败的成了粪渣，反抗成功的，就让别人吃屎。不信，你去查查历朝历代的帝王史。

不是怂不怂的事，中国要变得更好，得打破吃屎和让别人吃屎的周期性问题。

想想前些年也挺勇武的：08年那会儿，瓮安人因不满初二女学生李树芬死因的鉴定结果，十万人冲上街头，砸了县衙，最终逼着县令和捕快下课；还有乌坎人，几乎建立了一座勇武对抗的城堡；还有厦门，连岳召集众人上街抗议建化工厂，这么勇武剧集的镜头，至今也不过十来年。这十来年，男人吃了太多乌鸡白凤丸，连岳，变成了连岳不群。

最新的消息是，杭州人此时还在打开水龙头放水，水越来越发黄，味还很大……杭州水务部门那份辟谣通告，剧本根本说不通，情节与情节之间连个钩子都懒得设计，也不在乎你信不信。杭州市勇夺公共卫生饮用水监督技能竞赛团体冠军，杭州环境监测有限公司的法人同时身兼水务集团大股东，持股100%，发挥着自我监督的精神。就问，你服不服。

所以当前社会另一个主要矛盾就是：普通民众质问“信不信”与官方反问“服不服”的矛盾。

此时杭州的终极调查出来了，大意仍是气候异常，藻类不听话，水务部门很辛苦，只是未执行专项应急预案的要求，处理是：警告，诫勉，警告，只是轻轻地把环保公司总经理撤职了事。

对于这种自罚三杯的老套路，民众显然不服，只好用知乎网友提出的办法：当初我们天天要求日本官员喝一口福岛的水，证明水质未遭污染，现在我们就该要求杭州官员喝一口自来水，中国官员不可能连日本官员都不如吧。

这也做不到，我们的下一代还得吃屎。

      <title>王志安的立场墙外中国人的最大公约数</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/China_irl/comments/1m7ok2t/王志安的立场墙外中国人的最大公约数/</link>
      <description>标题里的“墙外中国人”指肉身在外**以及**翻墙的中国人。

建政领域里，王志安的 Youtube 订阅量似乎是最大的（我对这个圈子不甚了解，如果有订阅量有更大的 Youtuber 请指出）。

王志安的立场和他的对立面：

* **认同普世价值，认同自由、民主、法治，认为中国应该进行政治改革。**
   * 对立面是粉红。有粉红认为普世价值一点也不普世，民主、自由、法治都不如一党专政。有的粉红认为中国人素质低，无法实行自由民主。
   * 浪人也算个对立面。浪人认为中国人素质低，配不上自由民主。
* **希望中国人的生活变得更好。**
   * 粉红认为中国人的生活已经很好了。指出中国存在民生问题会让粉红不开心。粉红不关心普通人生活得好不好，只关心自己“赢”的心理需求。
   * 浪人认为中国生活得很糟糕，而且应该一直糟糕。指出中国人的生活有好的地方回让浪人不开心。浪人喜欢指出中国人有多糟糕，但这也不是为了改变中国人，而是为了粉红对立面的“赢”。
* **支持台湾维持现状，不支持武力统一**
   * 粉红甚至普通中国人都强力反对这点
* **把共产党当一个执政党看待：做得不好的地方就批评，做得好的地方也会指出来**
   * 粉红无法接受对共产党的批评，认为王志安反共。
   * 浪人无法接受对共产党的表扬，认为王志安是大外宣。
* **对于习近平，持负面的态度**
   * 粉红无法接受对共产党领袖的批评

从订阅数来看，王志安应该代表了墙外中国人的最大公约数。订阅他的人不一定会同意他的每个立场，但大概率会认同其中的几条。

他显然处于中间派。粉红和浪人两头不讨好。我觉得粉红和浪人在墙外是少数，虽然他们声音很大，但真正用订阅数投票的，还是同样处于中间地带的大多数人。

个人认为，他的节目风格和他的订阅数，让他成为了对中共造成最大伤害的人之一。

他不讨论抽象命题，比如共产党是好还是坏。他只要讨论一桩桩发生在国内的怪事，自然就能让人得出共产党多少有问题的结论。背后的逻辑秦晖已经指出过：无限权力承担无限责任。既然共产党号称自己永远伟大光荣正确，那出了这些事情共产党怎么解释呢？共产党怎么解决呢？

他也不太讨论政治哲学上的问题，比如普世价值是否是好的、中国是否应该民主化。这些他不讨论，他这些立场作为前提做节目，让听众潜移默化被影响。

当然，他的节目有很多事实性错误，有的社会事件他的判断也翻了车，但总的来说瑕不掩瑜。我希望他的节目越做越好，影响越来越大。也希望有更多像他一样的自媒体出现，通过有影响力的节目去改变中国。</description>

      <title>你们吃饱不要忘记老佛爷的3个馒头</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/China_irl/comments/1m7fw2d/你们吃饱不要忘记老佛爷的3个馒头/</link>
      <description>在你心中最崇拜的伟人是谁？



慈禧



在她的任上，中国创造了无数个第一。



中国第一家大型煤矿─开平矿务局，



中国第一家大型钢铁煤炭联合企业─汉冶萍厂矿公司，



中国第一家大型纺织企业─上海机器织布局，



中国第一家银行─中国通商银行，



中国第一家保险公司─保险招商局，



中国第一条电话线，



中国第一条铁路－－唐胥铁路，



中国第一条海底电缆、



中国第一条输电线路，



中国第一家发电厂，



中国第一家电报局，



......



与此同时她还为中国建立了第一支现代化军队，让中国军队有了：



第一艘现代化军舰，



第一支现代化陆军，



第一家现代化兵工厂，



第一门现代火炮，



第一家现代军校，



第一批留学军事人才，



第一批外国军事教官，



......



举不完的第一 ！



在她之前，中国处在一个落后的封建主义社会，她接手的是一个贫穷、愚昧、落后的破烂农业国。



她开办工业、引进现代教育、建立新式学校、大力引入西方科技、立宪改革、废除跪拜礼、开放报社……



她用呕心沥血的一生，让中国这个古老的封建帝国终于一直脚踏入了资本主义社会，让中国在近代以来第一次跟上了国际的脚步。



她走的时候，交给溥仪的能造工业炼钢、能造蒸汽机、能造轮船、能造步枪大炮的工业国家。



只是溥仪能力太弱，资历太浅，没能按照她的道路走下去，被袁世凯夺权。



她的晚年是孤独的——她明知道，在她走后，会迎来反扑。可她的接班人只有溥仪。



而溥仪根本不可能是老谋深算袁世凯的对手。



她在晚年经常流泪。

  
她接手的是一个扶木犁的国家，她留下的是一个拥有巡洋舰，可以自主建造轮船和铁路的国家。平定太平天国后，慈禧太后提到：“现在我们能造什么？能造桌子椅子，能造茶碗茶壶，能种粮食，还能磨成面粉，还能造纸，但是，一艘轮船、一门火炮、一辆火车都不能造。”

  
老佛爷被误解太久了，她的后人还不理解她

  
孩子哭了想妈，大人哭了想她

  
老佛爷比你多看五百年

  
饭要一口一口吃，路要一步一步走。



我们不能因为吃饱了全球化时代的第5个馒头，就忘记了是前面那4个馒头，才让我们摆脱了人类数千年来永无止境的隔绝，苦难，蒙昧！

  
人们说老佛爷万岁，她说人民万岁。</description>

      <title>去隔壁看了看，关于雅鲁藏布水电站。不得不说，反贼如果都这个水平，共产党能高枕无忧了</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/China_irl/comments/1m7q0ol/去隔壁看了看关于雅鲁藏布水电站不得不说反贼如果都这个水平共产党能高枕无忧了/</link>
      <description>1.这玩意蓄水，为了卡印度脖子，这样导致国际形势恶化？
雅鲁藏布江水电工程，只是截弯取直、隧洞引水，而非传统筑坝蓄水，所以对下游没什么影响。具体，就是会挖一个斜下隧洞，筑矮坝，将江水引入隧洞，流入下游河道。隧洞里将会修建5座阶梯水电站。不具备蓄水能力，你跟我说蓄水卡脖子？反贼和粉红爱国大V一家亲是吗？粉红爱国大V意淫这玩意卡三哥脖子，反贼也开始意淫了？没文化真可怕，好歹了解清楚该水电站的运行模式吧？别看见个水电站就以为是拦截蓄水。更何况印度那边的水源大部分是依赖每年降雨，真正上游的河水占比10%都不到，不然你可以猜猜为什么阿萨姆邦平原有大量的犀牛和大象？

2.20多年前，也吹三峡如何，电费降低了吗？
事实，现在维持几毛钱一度的电费还要什么自行车？不考虑货币本身的通货膨胀吗？以及中国用电量是否和几十年前一样？我这边反正很多年没涨价过了，而且要考虑，中国工业化高速发展，缺口越来越多，没有这些水电设施，只会更糟糕。

更何况三峡更多是水利工程啊，没有三峡大坝，反正重庆港真的凉透了，而且20年那波洪灾下游就死翘翘了（20年那波洪峰其实比98年大得多）

3. 这玩意地形如何，高海拔，等着死人吧？

事实，说真的，墨脱施工段是在喜马拉雅山南部，墨脱县城海拔还没有昆明高，最多和贵阳一个级别，没记错的话。背崩乡沿线更低。即便是在北线林芝地区挖，海拔也没有破3000。林芝不然为什么叫藏区江南？南林芝 藏南三隅海拔更低。
也就是海拔和施工毛关系？不如说一下，会不会延期的问题，大型机械如何翻越喜马拉雅山进入喜马拉雅山南麓。

4. 共产党没钱，根本完不成这个
你看看预算，这玩意整个投资还没有牢美加州高铁的钱多，不如先担心一下牢美吧哈。懒得反驳了

所以我现在很担心一些人讨厌共产党，以至于到反智的地步</description>

      <title>Does anyone know how much my PlayStation cover would be worth with all these signatures?</title>

      <description>I got my PlayStation signed at the R6 Manchester Major last year and I’ve been curious as to how much it would actually be worth. I’m not looking to sell it just curious.</description>

      <title>1500 Days ago, Ubisoft put the Nokk rework "on hold"</title>
      <link>https://i.redd.it/h9r6tq9v1oef1.png</link>
      <description>4 years ago, during Year 6, in Season 1 and Season 2, Ubisoft tested out a potential rework on Nokks ability, to address the many counters against her.

In this Rework, Nokk was able to bypass any electronic proximity based gadget set by defenders as long as HEL was active and not glitching (i.e. melusi banshees. Ela mines, proximity alarms etc.) alongside her invisibility on cameras, as well as visual feedback on your glove, which turns white when you're currently being looked at by a camera while you're invisible.

This put some weight off her shoulders, as she has a large range of counters to her ability and expose her location, jeopardizing her push and defeat her purpose.

This rework was tested in two versions. One during Crimson Heist, in which she had the rework on top of her regular ability (invisibility and noise reduction) and in North Star, in which she lost her noise reduction.

The noise reduction removal was what ultimately killed off this rework due to the negative feedback around this change, claiming it was part of her identity taken away.

Fast forward Ubisoft proceeded to remove her noise reduction anyway yet not give her the rework.</description>
