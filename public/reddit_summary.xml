      <title>Just realized my shoes have crossed the ten year mark.</title>

      <description>I slipped on my basic, budget option (at the time) Timberland sneakers this morning, and realized I’ve been wearing them since high school. They’re close to these (https://poshmark.com/listing/Timberland-Mens-Hommes-Shoes-678542b1c4b73ab639484b53) in style, but I’m finding it impossible to find the exact one I have. Mine seem slightly slimmer too. 
I have hiked in them, used them as a daily driver, treated them with no respect or leather care, and it’s been a decade. Only now do I see some damage from wear and tear starting, at the connective points between the leather and canvas at the front. I should treat them to some TLC. 
I didn’t buy them thinking they were going to last this well, so I guess it’s time to figure out a reasonable equivalent from their catalogue today. I can only hope their quality has remained consistent. 

Are there any items in your closet or home that surprised you by unexpectedly yielding incredible value?</description>

      <title>Suggest for my kitchenware?</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1mgc9q3/suggest_for_my_kitchenware/</link>
      <description>I'm looking for brands, features, and/or materials to consider for everything from measuring cups to frying pans to rolling pins and knife sets. 

My daughter is about to move out on her own. Sad. I'm going to give her my old stuff. That stuff if nice enough. It's lasted about 5 years, but its lifespan is close to an end. She'll be happy to have em for a couple more years, and I can use the moment to get some gooood stuff that I can keep forever. My husband's mom gave us some of her old stainless steel stuff, probably 30+ years old, still in perfect condition. I want to be able to give that to my daughter one day. 

I'm at a stage in my career where, for the most part, I don't have a budget. I wouldn't mind spending a few hundred or more to have stuff that will last. I've seen some, like, $1,200 pans. I ain't there, and that seems unnecessary for one pan, but basically any cost.</description>

      <title>Women’s crewneck T-shirt with a thick heavy neckline that won’t stretch out (Canada)</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1mg67js/womens_crewneck_tshirt_with_a_thick_heavy/</link>
      <description>Looking for a women’s crewneck, where the lining/rim around the neck is thick, stays flat, and doesn’t stretch out. I just love the look of a crewneck with a nice thick and defined fabric around the neck that keeps its  shape. Not looking for a men’s style T-shirt but also not looking for a super slim fit shirt (body image struggles). Slightly boxy, but not long would be preferable!

I’m in Canada and it needs to be something that can be ordered online!

      <description>Shout out to those of us insist on making things last through ingenuity and/or stubbornness. I will not let this relatively cheap umbrella die. Flew off the second floor deck at least 5 times in 10 years. The pole snapped in half once. Pvc pipe insert with some plumbing dodads worked a trick. Every time I think maybe a new one I remember this one has missed 2 cars windows. Luck is not to be discarded.</description>

      <title>Can someone advice on the the best e-ink "tablet" for my needs? I want to type Pages documents, use Substack, watch videos...</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1mfpv1n/can_someone_advice_on_the_the_best_eink_tablet/</link>
      <description>And it seems like the only one capable of all this is the top of the line boox? Note Max/Tab X C...Which are really expensive..  
  
I've been looking into the Remarkable 2, or the Boox line that come with a keyboard. I'm a bit scared of having to use a third party keyboards because in past experience they didn't work super well and were clunky to travel with.

  
I'd like to

\- Watch my course videos which are on a system called Wistia

\- Watch youtube videos/tiktok if possible

\- Edit my substack. I don't need to insert images or any of that, just for writing

\- use whatsapp (even just over wifi, I don't need data)

\- typing documents/notes in a keyboard, specifically Macbook Pages documents, and be able to sync them to iCloud like I do on my macbook (I don't know if that's possible or how else I would sync them, or if I have to export documents? That would be a real hassle)

\- I'd like it to be super portable so I can chuck it in my handbag with no extra floating accesories! which is why third party keyboard looks clunky

Any tips or experience welcome. I've been researching for a few days but still super confused. It seems like it's all or nothing. Like you either get a device for reading/handwriting, or you get a full laptop.

 Thank you!</description>

      <description>Hi everyone, 
I’m on the hunt for the ultimate E-Ink Android e-reader that supports Google Play Books, has text-to-speech functionality, and includes Bluetooth for seamless audiobook listening.
My goal is to find a device that lets me effortlessly switch between reading and listening to my books, combining both experiences for maximum flexibility. 
I was looking into the pocketbook, however I have heard some negative remarks regarding the tts.</description>

      <description>So, I was wondering which device was generally "better" in terms of acting as an solid e-reader for books, and an note-taking device? I have heard that in terms of note-taking, the Boox Go 7 Gen II wasn't fantastic. However, has anybody tried the BigMe B751C? If so, was that device any better in this case? For those who have tried both, in general, which one felt better? I am TORN between these two devices, and REALLY need help choosing. Thanks!</description>

      <title>BOOX refusing to comply with UK consumer law on faulty e‑reader</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1mg7f9y/boox_refusing_to_comply_with_uk_consumer_law_on/</link>
      <description>I bought a BOOX Go 10.3 less than a year ago directly from the BOOX European website. Through normal, intended use, the screen has developed visible cosmetic damage exactly where I use the bundled stylus for writing. This isn’t misuse - it’s a defect that only became apparent over time.

Under the UK *Consumer Rights Act 2015*, specifically:

* **s.9** – goods must be of satisfactory quality and fit for purpose, and the trader is responsible if they are not.
* **s.23** – if goods are faulty, the trader must repair or replace them at no cost to the consumer (including shipping and associated costs).

Despite this, BOOX has repeatedly sent me canned replies pointing to their internal “warranty policy,” demanding that I:

* Pay to ship the device to their repair centre in Poland
* Cover import duties when it’s returned

These costs are unlawful under UK consumer law. I’ve cited the legislation to them, but they keep ignoring it. You are not bound by their warranty.

I am now in the middle of discussions with Citizens Advice and preparing to escalate this to Trading Standards. I’m posting here because this is no longer just a product defect - it’s about BOOX operating outside UK law and disregarding their statutory obligations to their customers.

I’ve attached images of the defect so others can see the problem for themselves. UK buyers should take note: if BOOX won’t respect basic consumer protections, this could happen to you too.

      <title>Where should I start?</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1mgeicf/where_should_i_start/</link>
      <description>Hi all. I discovered this sub and these new devices with big hope.

I went through a long and tolling health process and as a result I unlocked a few lifetime perks, one being severe light sensitivity.

I now wear sunglasses most of the time outdoors. Indoors, I can't seem to finish a film undisturbed on TV and working at the PC really punishes my eyes. It pierces through. Even watching a YT video is very demanding sometimes. Interestingly, with the phone is sort of ok. With an old ereader with eink I have the experience is great and I can read for hours.

The problem is that I will start online university soon and I'm worried I won't be able to keep up. I will have to code a lot and watch educational videos often.
I have an IPS monitor Asus VG27AQ and tried endless configs, bought a Quntis frontlight and backlight,  a pair of Gunnar glasses that filter blue light but nothing really works.

Now I found out there are eink and RLCD monitors and I was wondering what could I get first to try out before I make a big inverstment. Perhaps starting with a small RLCD monitor or tablet. If it hurts, trying with eink and finally scale in size.

After reading this sub I came to realize I'm kind of limited because Ideally I would need color for programming and a minimal refresh rate for videos. Perhaps getting eink while playing videos on my current monitor as a secondary screen?

I would really appreciate your input here. Apologies for my English.

Edit: doctor said that my sight is fine. It's just the light that makes my eyes red and sore and the prescribed eye drops are of little relief.</description>

      <description>My girlfriend and I recently started a new collaborative project called getting a *baby*, so I made a small display that updates daily with our baby's progress. :)

It shows:

* The current day of the pregnancy
* The baby's approximate size (right now it's a sweet potato! 🥔)
* Fun facts about development at this stage
* An illustration of what things look like inside

The whole thing was inspired by this post:

      <description>人类本性是相同的，人的潜意识都向往一种自由空间，向往着能够运动，能够自由地交友，能够发展兴趣。
中国的问题是人口密度太大，体育场馆不足，陌生人之间的友善度不够，所谓的原子化，出去看到人就有一种防御，甚至是排斥讨厌。有很多沾染金钱习气的人。

我在美国的一个小镇就有一个网球场，跟俄罗斯女孩和乌克兰女孩还有一个乌拉圭男孩，我们四个经常去打网球，那场地周围是空旷的停车场，远处是树林和零星的房子，整个环境让人心情舒畅。

还有在加州的时候，草地上有墨西哥人踢球，五六个人一队，开小场，我看了一会儿，人们就让我进去踢，人们非常的友善。

（顺便一提，美国的孩子也非常有礼貌，我刚去美国时，在动物园，一群小学生看我像是新来的，就想给我当向导。）

在我印象中，中国有这样的氛围和场地，只有在几十年前，那时还有一些非常空旷的地方，房子也都不高。中国的现代化只是让人性更加异化了。

中国的这种从顶层控制的社会，最终会导致整个社会的细节会有一种压抑感，好像什么都是在夹缝中勉强开出的花。

在美国住了几年回国，感到特别不适应，那种陌生感，那种人一开口跟你说话的感觉，还有路上的行人那匆匆忙忙拥拥挤挤的社会面貌。

还是白人所住的环境好，无论是北美南美还是欧洲，澳洲，都是地广人稀，给人自由呼吸的一种空间。想要独处，不到5分钟就可以到达一个没人的地方，在一片草地的秋千上坐着呆一会。这种感觉我只有在童年的时候才有，那个时候中国没有城市化。
我这种感觉只有经历过八九十年代那种更加原始的社会的人才会有。我一点都不适应16年之后的中国，到处高楼大厦。很多一零后从小就生活在这种环境中，所以不会有我的感受。</description>

      <description>1.	⁠没有积极落实劳动保护法，没有积极提高人民收入（在我看来这个可能是最遭人仇恨的一部）
2.	⁠进一步激化了房价的雪崩
3.	⁠执行严格审查制度，完全收缩媒体的审查权力
4.	⁠修改宪法，无限连任
5.    给自己偶像化，我在江胡时代太小了，感觉的不多

我想请问大家，如果第一点改善了，能消除多少人对习政府的仇恨，这三点里面谁更让人深恶痛绝？大家可以rank by order （从最不喜欢开始）

欢迎大家补充其他的不满，我这里没列完</description>

      <description>从昨天开始，开始集中火力攻击受害者了。无非就那几条，受害者有钱，家里是大官。


这种典型的话术是己方实在没得洗了，就用一句绝对不参与对女性的围剿终结话题。同时营造男的也不是好东西的氛围。


问题是如果男的家里真的有权有势，能被大学处分？这些人是不是没在中国生活过？但是女拳师不讲逻辑，你要指出这逻辑漏洞就能喜提红大爷图片一张，外加拉黑一条龙服务.


我一开始认为女拳师只是傻，是分不清楚到底谁在压迫他，还想告诉她们找错重点。从这次的统一话术来看，她们知道中国主要矛盾是阶级矛盾。也知道利用阶级矛盾打击受害者，那说明她们就是纯坏。

此处鸣谢@Antarctica111 ，指正了我的失误，不是被开除，是被处分。</description>

      <description>巴基斯坦如何利用中国装备击落印度尖端战斗机

消息人士称，中国制造的PL-15导弹射程的情报失误是击落印度阵风战斗机的关键

阵风战斗机被击落引发了人们对西方硬件对抗中国替代武器有效性的质疑

巴基斯坦声称成功实施了电子战攻击，但印度对规模存在争议

此次战斗的结果激发了其他国家购买中国战斗机的兴趣

这场持续一小时的战斗在黑暗中进行，据专家估计，约有110架飞机参与，是几十年来全球规模最大的空战。据路透社5月援引美国官员的话报道，歼-10战机击落了至少一架阵风战斗机。此次击落令军事界许多人感到意外，并引发了人们对西方军事硬件对抗未经检验的中国替代武器有效性的质疑。

但路透社对两名印度官员和三名巴基斯坦官员的采访发现，“阵风”战机的性能并非关键问题：其被击落的核心原因是印度情报部门对歼-10战机发射的中国产霹雳-15导弹射程的失误。中国和巴基斯坦是仅有的两个同时拥有歼-10（又称“劲龙”）和霹雳-15导弹的国家。

印度官员表示，错误的情报让“阵风”战机飞行员误以为他们已经超出了巴基斯坦的射程，他们认为巴基斯坦的射程只有150公里左右。他们指的是被广泛引用的霹雳-15出口型的射程。

据巴基斯坦官员称，击中“阵风”战机的霹雳-15导弹是从大约200公里（124.27英里）外发射的，而印度官员则称其距离更远。这将使其成为有记录以来射程最远的空对空袭击之一。

5月7日空战后，印度开始瞄准巴基斯坦的军事基础设施，并在空中展现其实力。据双方官员称，印度制造的“布拉莫斯”超音速巡航导弹多次突破巴基斯坦的防空系统。5月10日，印度表示袭击了巴基斯坦至少9个空军基地和雷达站。据印度和巴基斯坦官员称，印度还击中了一架停放在巴基斯坦南部机库的侦察机。当天晚些时候，在美国官员与双方举行会谈后，双方达成停火协议。</description>

      <title>捷克通过新法：共产主义宣传等同纳粹</title>
      <link>https://twitter.com/dw_chinese/status/1951910812836106368</link>
      <description>捷克共和国签署刑法修正案，明确将宣传共产主义与纳粹主义等同视之。此举引发外界关注，拥有数万成员且在欧盟选举中表现成功的捷克共产党，未来是否将面临被禁的命运？

（德国之声中文网） 对于捷克坚定的反共产主义人士来说，这是一个漫长道路的终点：在1989年“天鹅绒革命”三十多年后，他们呼吁将共产主义者与国家社会主义者及类似威权意识形态等同对待，并相应予以禁止。

如今，这已成为现实：在7月下半月，捷克总统彼得·帕维尔 (Petr Pavel) 签署了一项刑法典修正案，明确将捷克共和国的国家社会主义和共产主义等同起来。随着总统的签署，立法程序正式完成。新法律将于2026年1月1日生效。

这项法律修改是由公民运动“十一月尚未结束”发起。该运动的领导者是天鹅绒革命时期的学生领袖、后来的参议员马丁·梅斯特日克（Martin Mejstrik）。此外，捷克研究极权主义政权研究所（USTR）的历史学家们也加入了这项倡议。今年春季，该修正案在众议院和参议院获得了总理彼得·菲亚拉（Petr Fiala）领导的亲欧执政联盟中一群议员和政治家的支持，并最终得以通过。

捷克共和国刑法典第403条的新措辞规定：“任何人建立、支持或宣传旨在压制人权和自由，或宣传种族、民族、国家、宗教或阶级敌意，或对其他人群敌意的国家社会主义、共产主义或其他运动，将处以一年至五年监禁。”</description>

      <title>从乡下人的角度回忆一下江胡时代</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/China_irl/comments/1mg9hkc/从乡下人的角度回忆一下江胡时代/</link>
      <description>本sub很多人在怀念江胡的年代，觉得那时候自由、充满希望。

那作为一个那从时候走过来的人，我试着回忆一下。

OP记事的时候，苏联还在。

小时候在农村，村里还没电视，新闻是通过村长的收音机播的，大部分人不会普通话，还得找个教书的翻译。

听众一般不多，苏联解体的时候，收音机那里却被围得水泄不通，个个都像被道士定住了身子，目瞪口呆。

虽然农民不关心时事，但是这件事还是冲击了他们的心灵。

印象最深的，就是一个搞传销的老乡来拉老爸入伙，说这生意一定靠得住，能赚钱。

老爸突然暴怒：“屌哪妈！！！！苏联都靠不住！你还能靠得住？！”

然后把他撵了出去。

突然之间，什么都靠不住了。

人的话靠不住，文件靠不住，文件上面的大红章子也靠不住。

靠得住的只有钱。

那时搞钱路子又多又野，

法律不禁止的可以做，

法律禁止的也可以做。

村子里面最有钱的，姑且叫他Z哥，Z哥靠开赌档起家，也卖女人和毒品。

发达了他搬到城里去，听说几房二奶。但是赌档还在村镇里，靠老乡把持。

有一次新上任的派出所领导，跟他谈分成没谈妥，就派人过来砸他的赌档。

他派人聚集了一大帮老乡，跟警察开打。

明码实价，卸掉警察一只手多少钱，卸掉一条腿多少钱。

他手下有个胆大的，用工地的十字镐凿穿了一个警察的大腿，我看过照片，血流得像满地的猪红。

人立刻被抓了，不知道被判的死刑活刑。

Z哥给他家人补了一大笔钱，还送了一个金劳力士。没多久那家人新房就盖起来了，他家人对Z哥感恩戴德，就差做成菩萨像在家里供起来。

一上任就出这种恶性警民冲突，所长也下来了。

新的所长很快跟Z哥谈好了分成，相安无事。该赌钱的赌钱，该输钱的输钱，该喝农药的喝农药。

Z哥靠老乡平事，所以他对老乡很好，有老乡到城里，他经常会小小招待一番。

有一次我爸要去城里，就说带我去拜访一下Z哥，见见世面。

出发前一天晚上，我妈给我裤子的内里缝了一个暗兜，在里面缝了十块钱，那个时候的十块钱叫大团结，是最大力的钞票，她就告诉我，城里非常乱，一定要抓紧爸爸的手。要是被坏人抓走，就会打断我手脚，在火车站讨饭。

那时候的火车站人是真的多啊，小小站台上站满了三教九流各路人马，有人拎着包，有人挑着笼子，笼里装着走地鸡，有人背着蛇皮袋，蛇皮袋里面的东西还一动一动，不知道是啥。

车站台上的民警拿着大竹竿子，一边大声叫骂，一边把人赶到黄线内。

火车不久就来了，是绿皮的，在铁轨上哐哐直响。

门一开大家就发了疯一样往上挤，像一群老鼠在逃生。

那时候火车又挤又脏，座位上，过道上都坐满了人，有人在大声聊天，有人在抽烟，有人在打牌，有人在嗑瓜子，瓜子皮就直接吐在地上，还不时往地上吐一口痰，绿莹莹的，跟瓜子皮糊在一起。

我爸带着我这个拖油瓶，自然抢不到好位子，只能站在车门边。

门边是厕所。

厕所那种浓烈的味道足以让人毕生难忘。

车开了一半，我就跟我爸说想要尿尿，我爸说让我等会儿，我说我等不及了。他就让我上了。

打开厕所门的一感觉，不是臭。

是痛。

眼睛痛。

可能是气味过于浓烈，辣到眼睛。

小小的蹲便池，大便已经溢出来了。周围的地板，黄的，黑的，新鲜的，旧的，硬的、软的、糊状的大便，拉的到处都是。

我像寻找绿洲一样寻找可以下脚的地方，好不容易憋着气把尿拉完。

出来的时候，车厢里面的汗臭味我闻起来简直香甜。

出了车站，第一感觉。

城里人人人人人人人多啊！

从二楼看出，整个车站，还有站外的广场，乌泱泱的都是黑色的人头，像一大窝在搬食的蚂蚁。

我爸拖着我，硬是从大人们的屁股中挤出一条路。

我还记得我爸的手臂，青筋暴突，肌肉像榕树根一样，快要把我的手腕捏碎，生怕我走丢了。

走到人少一点的地方，我见到过道上有几个小孩，有些没了眼球，有些没了手，有些没了脚，有些手脚还在，但是被打断了，扭得像盆栽一样，面前放着破碗，一见有人来了就发了疯一样磕头。我爸跟我说这些都是被拐卖的小孩子，讨不到足够的钱，回去手脚还得少一些。

一出火车站，我们马上被一群摩托车包围了，摩的司机扯着喉咙问我们去哪里，有些人直接开始报价。我爸好不容易挤开他们，等他们走远了，还不时警惕地回头看看。

那个时候开摩托车的除了摩的司机，还有砍手党，看到你拎包，骑着摩托拿着菜刀把你连包带手砍走，听说他们最爱拜的是关二爷，可能觉得二爷骑着赤兔马，提着关刀冲向华雄的样子跟他们有点像。

除了摩托车，路上还有四个轮子的小汽车，他们一停下来，就会有些打赤脚的小孩，拿着黑乎乎的破抹布，上去擦拭他们的车窗，把本就不干净的玻璃擦得更黑。

擦完之后，小孩就会用力敲打车门，跟司机讨钱。

给钱的不多，更多的司机是降下车窗，挥舞着扳手和铁锤子把他们吓走。那时候拦路打劫的多，车上一般都备着家伙。

走上天桥，开始出现各种浓妆艳抹的女人，不停走过来跟我爸报价。指着一些房子说，地方就在旁边，很方便的。那些房子开着门，落着帘子，墙上贴着香港三级片的海报。

我爸带着我，自然没理会。

我们上了巴士，售票员接过皱巴巴的钞票，装进腰包，撕下车票和找零递过去。

其中一个女人大叫着少找了钱，和售票员大吵起来，车上一片混乱。有人趁乱扒开下车门，身子一侧溜了进来。

Z哥请我们在酒店吃饭。

这里简直是个异世界。

酒店很高，我要把后脑勺仰到贴着脖子，才能看到楼顶，太阳照在玻璃幕墙上闪闪发光，让我睁不开眼。

入口是玻璃旋转门，一转动，就放出一股带着淡香的冷气。拆射的阳光扫过一尘不染的地板，圣洁又干净。

我走路小心翼翼，生怕踩脏了地板。

里面每个人都干干净净，不慌不忙，好像外面的俗世与他们无关。

Z哥向我爸招手，带我们进了包间。里面还有他的老婆（或者二奶？）女儿。

第一次见到他女儿，印象很深刻——太干净了，像极了教科书走出来的小孩。

在农村，小孩是一种介乎于动物和人之间的存在，肮脏，野蛮，残忍。你打不过他，他就会来打你，你抢不过他，他就会来抢你。

我是第一次见到这样的小孩，干干净净，安安静静，头发油亮得发光。

所以我很好奇地盯着她，她也盯着我，我盯着她的鞋子，她穿着球鞋，白得像雪，一点污迹都没有。

我穿着拖鞋，后跟断了一半，脚和裤脚到是泥巴。

我问她鞋子怎么那么干净，她只是盯着我看，估计没听懂，因为我说的是乡下土话，普通话上大学才学着讲。

她妈把她拉开，可能怕我教坏她。

我盯着她妈的鞋子看，发现很奇怪，同样是拖鞋，但是她的鞋子后跟很高，鞋顶像鱼嘴一样，露出两个雪白的脚趾。后来我才知道，那叫高跟鞋。

服务员上了很多好菜，我面前是一块很大的牛肉，上来的时候还滋滋作响，我不会用刀叉，用手去抓，被烫了一下。

她妈用刀给我切开，我看到里面是生的，但是肚子饿了，抓起一块就吃，那种香味至今还记得。成年后我吃过各种牛扒，但是没有一块给我留下印象。

吃饱后，我去上厕所，里面一点异味都没有，窗明几净，比我家厨房还干净。

方便后，我到大厅溜了一圈，有人在大厅弹琴，琴声悠悠飘在空中，和香气混在一起，脚下的地毯软绵绵的，旋转门折射的阳光不时扫过。

这里像天堂一样。

回到包间，我爸已经喝高了，开始说农村的粗俗土话，Z哥的女人脸色开始不太好看，带着她女儿走了。

那天我爸喝了很多好酒，非常高兴。

回到村里，到处跟人说Z哥就是好，那么有钱还不嫌弃老乡，就该他发达，就该那么多人替他卖命。

后来我考了大学，村里敲锣打鼓的，我又见到了Z哥。

他没怎么老，很热情地握着我的手，说以后多联系什么的。后来他们举家出了国。我有他女儿的Facebook，那时候还不需要翻墙。

她女儿不时晒国外五星酒店的美食美照，Z哥也不时出镜，穿着西装，笑得慈眉善目。但是看着他的笑容，我总会想起一把沾满血的十字钉镐。

后来我去城里工作，那个年代像一场梦一样，在时间里变得模糊而遥远。

现在回忆那个年代，我总是想起那个去城里见世面的下午，想起酒店那扇旋转的玻璃门。

玻璃门把那个年代分成了两半。

门内的世界，干净，美好。

门外的世界，肮脏、混乱、贫穷、残忍。

我只在门里呆了一个下午，更多的时候，我在门外挣扎着求存。

现在却总有人将那个时代拿出来，说多么多么美好，多么多么自由。

我理解他们。

在那个时代，他们活在玻璃门里面，穿着西装，喝着红酒，吃着溢血的牛扒。

但我没忘记，在那个时代，更多的人，在玻璃门外像野兽一样活着，有人在黑暗的过道里乞讨，有人在破房里张着腿接客，有人在黑牢里挨打，还有人被十字镐钉穿大腿，躺在地上默默地流血。</description>

      <description>I haven't put all the US and CAD operators here but every single US and CAD operator doesn't have the country.

This confuses me because as far as I know Ubisoft is a French company that really should have French defaultism before it has North American Defaultism.</description>
