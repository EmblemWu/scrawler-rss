      <title>Help my mom fix or replace her Bernina sewing machine, please!</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1m2qmd2/help_my_mom_fix_or_replace_her_bernina_sewing/</link>
      <description>My mom (70-80 y.o. range) is a huge sewer and suilter. She's about to have a major surgery that leaves her with reading and seeing as options during recovery....and her machine just quit (again). I need help with ideas for either the current machine or a replacement (and where to get it). 

My mom has her original machine that she got herself way back when. As mentioned, recently, she's had issues with her machine so got a spare on eBay and now that's not right. I'm sharing the info she gave me here below. 

Again, I'm sharing this to see if anyone can suggest ideas of where to go (or what to look into), or an alternative, modern version to just buy. She doesn't want all the bells and whistles, electronics, many machines have today. 

Thank you for any ideas! 

Her info:

"Bernina 830 Record, made in Switzerland.  Purchased 1975.  The light does work.  The pedal plug does go in, but the pedal does not work, no matter how strongly you press on it.  This was serviced one month ago.  At first it was fine, then stopped in the middle of a seam.

Backup (from eBay) Bernina 830.  Also a mechanical machine.  The light does not turn on and the pedal doesn't work.

I do know that the cord number is usually 329.164.04    The pedal number is 325.213.14; type 323.

These machines are both from the 1970s and do not have all the fancy electronics of today.  All metal machines.

I am the only person who has ever used my 830 Record.  They have been serviced three times in the last two years.  Each time they worked for a while, but never just completely stopped."</description>

      <title>Fire pit available in the UK</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1m2y7hc/fire_pit_available_in_the_uk/</link>
      <description>Looking for a durable, long-lasting fire pit available in the UK. I’d like something about knee height, still fairly wide, but movable by one person if needed.

I love the look of US brands like Ohio Flame, but they’re not available here and cost a fortune to ship.

Any solid UK-made or UK-available options that fit the Buy It For Life ethos?

Thanks!</description>

      <title>Fed up with cheap pruning shears. What's the rec?</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1m2y9ou/fed_up_with_cheap_pruning_shears_whats_the_rec/</link>
      <description>I'm a keen gardener and I feel like I'm just throwing money away on garbage tools.

I've gone through three pairs of cheap secateurs from the big box stores in the last five years. The springs always go or the blades get dull and wont hold an edge no matter how much I sharpen them. They just feel flimsy.

I'm ready to invest in a proper pair that will last. Something with replaceable parts and steel that actually holds an edge. I keep seeing Felco (specifically the Felco 2) and ARS mentioned as the top choices.

Are they really worth the money? Is there one that's better than the other for general garden use (pruning roses, small branches etc)? Appreciate any advice from people who've had theirs for years.</description>

      <title>Any alternatives to Herman Miller chairs?</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1m2ycsi/any_alternatives_to_herman_miller_chairs/</link>
      <description>I just cant wrap my head around spending $1000 on a chair and don’t even get me started on $2000 Embody Logitech. that's truly insane!

No shade to any brand. I get that big brands offer great service, warranty and tons of money into design mkt... which would increase the cost considerably, but at $2000 the price actually reflect true value. You'd expect it to be universally loved if you can afford it.

Are there any alternatives to Herman Miller more cheaper?</description>

      <title>Made a little tool to help me find practical, durable, and quality products people actually like (not sponsored stuff)</title>
      <link>http://buydit.org</link>
      <description>So… I have a bit of a decision problem. I kept finding myself deep in Reddit threads for anything I buy trying to figure out which products people actually like, without getting lost in fake reviews or “influencer” noise.

Anyway, I hacked together this little site called [Buydit.org](https://buydit.org/) — it basically searches Reddit for product mentions and shows you stuff that’s been talked about positively. No ads, no tracking, no fluff. Just vibes and upvotes.

I mostly built it for myself, but figured it might be useful for others here too. Totally free. No signups or anything. Just type in like “cruelty-free skincare” or “Motorcycle bluetooth system” and it’ll dig through posts for you.

Would love feedback if you try it — or not, that’s cool too. Thanks for reading 🙃</description>

      <title>Women’s underwear similar in fit to aerie sizes</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1m2pm88/womens_underwear_similar_in_fit_to_aerie_sizes/</link>
      <description>Hi all I have not posted in this subreddit before, but have been a lurker for a while. I come with a conundrum.

I (32F) am a short short queen. I am under 5 foot and not even 95 pounds soaking wet. I have a very square shaped body and essentially have a similar body to a 12-year-old boy.

So far in my life , since I was a teen, the only underwear that I could find that would fit me and look remotely flattering were the xxs size of underwear at aerie. 

I’ve come to the point that I really want to stop buying their underwear. My favorite kind : French cut bikini type, have degraded in quality so intensely that new ones can only get a few months of wear out of them before they become see-through and have holes.
They are fast fashion and quite frankly I hate supporting them.

The problem is, I can’t find anything similar that I like the fit of  ( French cut but not high waisted) or the comfortability (all cotton with a little spandex) that actually makes underwear small enough for my butt. 
I kid you not, extra smalls or even XXS in other brands, fall off my butt. 

Does anyone know of a brand that fits some of these criteria that I should try?</description>

      <description>Everywhere you go in this sub and all over the internet it’s the only chair that get’s recommended.

      <title>A list of BIFL not made in the USA</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1igl1ab/a_list_of_bifl_not_made_in_the_usa/</link>
      <description>A timely reminder that this subreddit is obviously very USA-centric with its recommendations as that’s where the majority of users are from. It often leads to people not realising that comparable and/or better items can be found closer to home, easier, cheaper and free of tolls.

I thought it would be a good idea to crowdsource some manufacturers here for non-American users.

This isn't neccesarily items made in those countries as some manufacturers use factories across the world but with a commitment to quality

I can start (I'm kind of UK/Euro centric so it would be great to expand this):

**Clothing**  
Portuguese Flannel - Portugal  
Naked and Famous - Canada  
Uskees - UK   
Yarmouth Oilskins - UK  
Carrier Company - UK  
Old Town - UK (Closing down)  
Farmer's Market - Iceland (may be hard to buy outside of Iceland)  
Oni Denim - Japan  
Iron Heart - Japan  
Barbour - UK  
Companion - Spain  
NÄZ - Portugal (only women)  
Meindl - Germany (they run a high quality fashion brand but are known for great hiking boots)

**Outdoor Gear**  
Fjällräven - Sweden  
Rab - UK (offer a very good repair service)  
66° North - Iceland  
Devold - Norway  
Bergans- Norway  
Haglöfs - Sweden  
Klättermusen - Sweden  
Alpkit - UK

**Footwear**  
Solovair - UK  
Mayura Boots - Spain  
Church's - UK  
Loake - UK  
Wm. Lennon - UK  
Astorflex - Italy

**Kitchen/Cookware**  
Le Cresuet - France  
De Buyer - France  
Fissler - Germany  
WMF - Germany (very wide and variable range but Made in Germany stuff good)  
Fiskars - Finland  
Duralex - France  
Samuel Groves - UK

**Appliances/Small appliances**  
Miele - Germany  
Dualit - UK  
Moccamaster - Netherlands (Coffee makers)  
Zojirushi - Japan  
Numatic - UK (vacuum cleaners)  
Sebo - Germany (vacuum cleaners)  
Ankarsarum - Sweden

Edit - Some excellent feedback. I'll try and work my way through and add what I can! Please note that I will only add stuff that I have experience with but all the comments help with crowd sourcing knowledge.</description>

      <title>Buyitforlife from Canada, what’s your favourite things made in Canada?</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1igcxqb/buyitforlife_from_canada_whats_your_favourite/</link>
      <description>With the now starting trade war between the US and Canada I feel it’s best for us up north to support local more than ever.

One of my favourite clothing brands is Anian from Victoria, BC. I have a few of their shirts and will probably end up getting more.

Edit: Adding some other brands up here that I personally own and love.

Canada West Boots - Made in Winnipeg. Been wearing a pair of Romeos for a couple years now.

Popov Leather - Made in Nelson, BC. have a few of their leather goods, holding up really well.

Meyer - PEI. High quality made in Canada pots and pans, I have their non-stick 12”.</description>

      <title>System update for my Penstar E-Note</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1m1xhdq/system_update_for_my_penstar_enote/</link>
      <description>Booted up my Penstar E-Note after not using it for a month or so, and lo and behold, it informs me of a system update.

Was quite surprised since I hadn’t seen any updates  since I had purchased it back in December of last year.

Will post if I find anything interesting.

Now really wish Penstar would get on the ball and release the new tablets they showed off at CES2025 back in February.

I get it, China is a financial and business mess right now, so any new electronics devices may end up dying on the vine due to lack of available manufacturers, but a person can still hope.</description>

      <title>Go 7 vs Tab Mini C performance ?</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1m1zdlv/go_7_vs_tab_mini_c_performance/</link>
      <description>So I previously had a Tab Mini C and sold it - I initially bought it thinking it would be useful for reading academic papers and taking notes but frankly the size was just not practical, and the neo reader app while trying its best, sucked at reflowing pdfs to read. Note taking was well not spacious for sharing half a page with a pdf. Though by itself, the note taking worked just fine. It was also a bit heavy for its size, and frankly, the colour sscreen sucked 

I do realize by the time i bought the tab mini c earlier this year, it was already a dated device

I had Nexus 7 for the longest time that just died, so I'm missing a small tablet.

  
Ive tempered my expectations, so I just want an eink device that I can use to not only read,but use to take notes reliably.

  
This time it'll just be for note taking, so thats enough real estate for me ( I read from a pc or a printed paper and scribe my notes on to the device ) 

  
So for anyone who has tried both devices, are there notable differences with the performance ?</description>

I'll be in *Zhèjiāng* province, and will most likely travel to whatever big cities that are relatively close (definitely Shanghai). Any official stores, Tech Malls, whatever stores or other places that may carry them are very welcome in the replies.</description>

      <title>Best E-ink Phones Exclusively for Reading</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1m215aj/best_eink_phones_exclusively_for_reading/</link>
      <description>I have a Samsung S23 Ultra and a Kindle Paperwhite 5 (I think?).  I'm looking to get a secondary phone that's used exclusively for reading e-mail newsletters, substack, pdf, and epubs on the go. 

I'll still be using my Samsung as my main phone, and maybe a Kindle for when I want a simulated book reading experience. 

The thing is, my eyes hurt from using my phone too much. On the other hand, my Kindle doesn't fit in many of the bags I use daily. I also find it limiting at times since the interface is pretty wonky for most online websites (I'm getting into reading online magazines lately.) 

I heard about e-ink phones, and I am interested in the whole "e-ink hurts my eyes less" feature. But I wanna hear from actual e-ink phone users about what their experience was like with this type of phone. 

  
1. Now that you have an e-ink phone, what are some of the things you wish you knew before buying? 

2. Do you think they're heavy for long reading sessions? Screen and font size too small or just right? Think 3-4 hours. 

3. Would getting one primarily as a reading device be worth the price? The phones I'm looking at are around the $200 - $400 range, but do let me know if there are better phones for better prices out there.</description>

      <title>Bigme Hibreak Pro worked yesterday, no longer works today</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1m2aral/bigme_hibreak_pro_worked_yesterday_no_longer/</link>
      <description>Hello everyone,

This morning, my Hibreak Pro got stuck on the startup screen: the BIGME logo with the letters flashing one after the other in a loop. He was in charge all night as usual.

Here's what I tried:

* Recovery mode + forced shutdown
* Force restart by holding the power button. But nothing works — it's still stuck on the flashing logo.

Luckily I had an old phone I could fall back on, but I'm really disappointed. I had high hopes for this device.

I have two questions:

1. The phone contains important work-related data from the past few days. Is there any way to access it via USB in its current state?
2. Is there a method to restart the phone without doing a full reset?</description>

      <title>Is there an e-ink tablet that is good for authors trying to write/organize a book?</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1m2fhhq/is_there_an_eink_tablet_that_is_good_for_authors/</link>
      <description>I love the concept of using an e-ink tablet to write a book. However, the software on both the remarkable 2 and kindle scribe are lacking.  I am looking for something that can search handwritten text (preferably without converting it). Something that allows you to organize a book (for example, allowing headlines with hyperlinks to a side menu). And something that has seamless integration with your computer (and perhaps phone). Can any e-ink tablets do this?  Any authors out there use an e-ink tablet to write part of a book? Ideally, I would like to switch between typing on my laptop and handwriting on a tablet.</description>

      <title>Best external monitor/display for light sensitivity/eye strain</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1m2v4wc/best_external_monitordisplay_for_light/</link>
      <description>Hi folks,

I'm looking for an external display for eye strain.  I've read the sub, but I would be grateful for your insight for my particular use scenario.

My eyes:

* light sensitivity and pain (to sunlight, to artificial light, to screens)
* **the larger the screen, the worse the eye strain** (I can use a darkened iphone, but an ipad or laptop is hard even with decreased brightness and migraine glasses)
* Remarkable tablet works great for my eyes
* I seem to do better when the room is well lit (to minimize backlighting contrast with the environment)

My needs:

* humanities professor, reading lots of pdfs, writing, using Word, Google Docs, Powerpoint, Scrivener...
* don't need color 
* would like \~25" size

My budget:

*  I'd love to hear about the "best" options and the "value" options

My location

* United States

I see a lot of people here say that *small* screens are worse for their eyes.  For me it's *large* screens that are worse. So I'd be interested in hearing from people who have a similar issue.

What to look for? What to avoid?

Thank you!</description>

      <title>Need a recommendation for an 8” e-reader</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1m2sjtt/need_a_recommendation_for_an_8_ereader/</link>
      <description>I’m looking for suggestions/opinions/recommendations for an e-reader with a screen close to 8 inches. My wife has a kobo libra color and I find that the 7 inch screen is a little small for my liking. 

Other things that I’m looking for are:

-Black and white screen; color is nice but I don’t really need it

-Stylus support - I’m looking to be able to take notes or do some light design/sketching, so this is fairly important

-Good battery life

-Priced between $250-350 including the cost of the stylus if it doesn’t come with one

I’m looking forward to hear what you all think would be a good fit for me!</description>

Disclosure: This news has only been released in Chinese so we don’t have the full information of these e-ink devices yet. They will be released in China only for now (specifically on 15 April 2025) and will come to the international markets later on.  
⁝  
The Mira Pro Color is a **25.3 inch** e-ink color monitor and will also use Kaleido 3. It’ll be interesting to see how it compares to the Revo monitors from Dasung. It will cost 9499 yuan which comes to around **1300$**.</description>

中法建交40周年之际， 胡sir雄文， 彩虹马屁大赞法兰西， 并在8964后官方主动第一次重提“政治体制改革”。 欧洲人眼睛瞪得像铜铃。 同年3月， 欧洲议会对华关系代表团访华， 出席十届全国人大二次会议的闭幕式， 吴邦国领队接待。 &#13;

&#13;
在法国国民议会的演讲&#13;
2004年1月27日&#13;
中华人民共和国主席 胡锦涛&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
尊敬的德勃雷议长先生，&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
各位议员，&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
女士们，先生们：&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
　　今天，有机会来到久负盛名的波旁宫，同各位议员见面，我感到十分高兴。首先，我代表中国政府和人民，向在座各位，向伟大的法兰西人民，致以良好的祝愿！&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
　　法兰西民族和中华民族都是历史文化悠久的伟大民族，虽然分处欧亚大陆两端，相距万里之遥，但两国人民的交往源远流长。500年前，法国文学巨匠拉伯雷在其传世之作《巨人传》中就曾喻示“智慧的神瓶”在中国。18世纪，法国启蒙运动思想家伏尔泰、孟德斯鸠等人在其划时代的著述中，从伦理道德、科学技术和民风民俗等方面，对中国进行了引人入胜的描述。在法国启蒙先哲的推动下，欧洲曾出现过长达半个世纪的“中国热”。19世纪以来，西学东渐，法兰西文明被大量介绍到中国。伏尔泰、孟德斯鸠、卢梭、笛卡尔、雨果、巴尔扎克、大仲马等大师的作品多次被翻译成中文，为中国人了解西方打开了重要窗口。法国大革命为近代中国人民推翻封建专制统治的斗争带来了重要启迪。20世纪初，许多满怀救国救亡之志的中国学子负笈赴法求学，寻求改造中国的道路和现代思想艺术的灵感。在这些人中，既出现了周恩来、邓小平、陈毅等中国革命的杰出领袖，也出现了巴金、钱钟书、徐悲鸿、冼星海等中国文学艺术的著名大师。两国文化漫长的交流和借鉴，为中法两国人民的友谊和两国关系的发展打下了重要基础。&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
　　40年前，毛泽东主席和戴高乐将军高瞻远瞩，决定在中法这两个东西方大国之间建立大使级外交关系，从而揭开了中法关系崭新的一页。40年来，在两国几代领导人和各界人士的共同努力下，中法关系经历了时间和国际风云变幻的考验。尤其是近年来，两国在各领域的交流和合作取得了令人瞩目的成果，两国关系日臻成熟和牢固。&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
　　在中法建交40周年之际，我来到法兰西共和国访问，就是要向世人表明，巩固和发展中法关系是中国的既定方针，我们将为此而不懈努力。&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
　　法兰西民族为人类文明进步作出了巨大贡献。法兰西文化是人类文化的瑰宝，具有很强的包容性和创新能力。在当今世界上，法国以其发达的经济、先进的科技、独特的文化和独立的外交发挥着重要作用。中国高度重视中法关系，将一如既往地从战略高度和长远角度审视两国关系，愿同法方一道努力，把两国关系不断推进到更高水平。这次来访，我同希拉克总统进行了广泛而深入的交谈。我们一致认为，在当前国际形势发生深刻变化的条件下，推动中法全面战略伙伴关系的深入发展，不仅符合两国人民的根本利益，也有利于世界的和平、稳定与繁荣。为此，双方应着重在以下三个方面作出努力。&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
　　第一，加强政治互信，深化战略合作。中法两国作为联合国安理会常任理事国，都是对国际事务具有重要影响的国家。我们两国都赞成促进世界多极化，主张维护联合国的权威，愿意推动建立符合各国人民意愿的国际政治经济新秩序。在应对人类面临的各种挑战和妥善处理重大国际事务等方面，我们两国有着广泛共识和共同利益。我们愿同法国在反对恐怖主义、防扩散、打击跨国犯罪、促进共同发展和加强联合国作用等重大问题上加强对话和磋商，进行密切合作，致力于维护世界和平、促进共同发展。&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
　　第二，加强经贸合作，实现互利互补。中国是世界上最大的发展中国家，正在全力进行现代化建设，具有广阔的市场。法国是发达国家，经济科技水平处于世界前列，在很多领域拥有领先技术。我们两国经济互补性很强，经贸合作潜力巨大。40年前，两国贸易额仅为1亿美元。去年，两国贸易额超过了130亿美元。法国在华投资共2302项，实际投入金额61.4亿美元，位居欧洲国家前列。但是，坦率地说，相对于两国在国际贸易中的地位和两国经济的互补性，中法经贸合作的潜力还没有充分发挥出来。中国已形成每年4100多亿美元的进口大市场。中国的进一步发展将为包括法国在内的世界各国提供更多的商机。我们愿同法国深化在高技术、农业、环保和中小企业等领域的全面合作，不断开拓合作的新领域，推动经贸关系不断迈上新台阶，使两国成为稳定的经贸合作伙伴。&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
　　第三，加强文化交流，丰富交往内涵。文化交流是各民族深入交往的重要渠道，也是各民族和谐相处的重要基础。不同文化的相互借鉴和融合，对增进各国人民的相互了解十分重要。中法都有着民族特点鲜明的灿烂文化，也互为对方的文化所吸引。深入发展文化交流，不仅有利于促进我们两国文化的繁荣发展，也有利于促进世界不同文明之间的对话与沟通，有利于人类社会的和谐与进步。正在法国举行的中国文化年活动，向法国人民生动地展示了中国古老文化的迷人魅力和中国当代文化的蓬勃活力。今年10月，法国文化年活动将在中国举行。我相信，这项活动将受到中国人民的喜爱。我们愿意进一步加强两国文化交流，促进中华文明和法兰西文明这两个伟大文明的相互借鉴，让这两朵人类文明奇葩在绚丽多姿的世界文化百花园中进一步绽放出夺目的异彩。&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
　　女士们、先生们！&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
　　中华民族有着悠久的历史，在5000多年的历史演进中创造了灿烂的文明，为人类社会发展作出了不可磨灭的贡献。16世纪以前，中国经济科技发展处于世界前列。16世纪以后，在世界科技文化快速发展的潮流中，中国逐渐落伍了。19世纪中叶以后，由于封建统治的腐败和列强的侵略，中国逐渐成为半殖民地半封建国家。中国人民为改变自己的悲惨命运，进行了长期的奋争。上个世纪中叶，在中国共产党的领导下，中国人民终于取得了新民主主义革命的胜利，建立起自己当家作主的新国家，掌握了自己的命运，并走上了社会主义道路。25年前，在邓小平先生的领导下，中国开始实行改革开放的新政策，探索社会主义发展的新道路，全力推进现代化建设，取得了举世瞩目的成就。&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
　　从1979年到2003年，经过25年坚持不懈的努力，中国社会生产力和综合国力不断迈上新台阶，社会主义市场经济体制初步建立，开放型经济已经形成，各项社会事业全面发展，人民生活总体上达到小康水平。为了具体地说明问题，我这里列举一组数据。25年前，中国年国内生产总值为1473亿美元，现在已达到14000多亿美元。25年前，中国年进出口贸易总额为206亿美元，现在已达到8512亿美元。25年前，中国实际利用外资的项目基本没有，现在利用外资累计已达到6796亿美元。25年前，中国外汇储备为1.67亿美元，现在已达到4033亿美元。25年前，中国农村贫困人口为2.5亿人，现在已减少到3000万人左右。25年前，中国没有1公里高速公路，现在已有29800多公里。25年前，中国固定电话用户为192万户，现在已超过2.6亿户，移动电话用户也超过2.6亿户，平均每月还新增525万户。从这些数字可以看出，同25年前相比，中国的面貌发生了前所未有的变化。&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
　　中国之所以能够发生这样巨大的变化，最关键的原因是我们始终坚持走中国特色社会主义道路，始终坚持改革开放，不断消除阻碍生产力发展的体制性障碍，激发了全体人民的创造性、积极性和主动性，有力地促进物质文明、政治文明和精神文明的协调发展。中国的改革是全面改革，涉及经济、政治、文化等各个领域。我们不仅进行经济体制改革，也进行政治体制改革。发展社会主义民主政治，是我们始终不渝的奋斗目标。我们明确提出，没有民主就没有社会主义，就没有社会主义现代化。我们积极推进政治体制改革，完善社会主义民主的具体制度，保证人民充分行使民主选举、民主决策、民主管理、民主监督的权利。这些年来，我们在国家领导制度、立法制度、行政管理体制、决策制度、司法制度、人事制度、基层民主制度、监督制约制度等方面进行了一系列改革，取得了显著成果。中国人民的公民权利、政治权利和基本自由依法得到维护和保障。中国已加入了21个国际人权公约。中国全国人大已经批准了《经济、社会和文化权利国际公约》。中国政府正在积极研究《公民权利和政治权利国际公约》涉及的重大问题，一旦条件成熟，将向中国全国人大提交批准该公约的建议。我们将继续坚定不移地推进政治体制改革，贯彻依法治国方略，建设社会主义法治国家，不断发展社会主义民主政治。&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
　　中国改革开放取得了很大成就，但中国有13亿人口，底子薄，生产力不发达，发展很不平衡。虽然中国国内生产总值排在世界前六位，但人均国内生产总值刚刚超过1000美元，排在世界一百位以后。中国要实现现代化，使全体人民都过上富裕生活，还有很长的路要走。我们已经确立了本世纪头20年的发展目标，这就是集中力量全面建设小康社会，到2020年实现国内生产总值比2000年翻两番，达到4万亿美元，人均国内生产总值达到3000美元。为实现这一目标，我们将在邓小平理论和“三个代表”重要思想的指引下，坚持以经济建设为中心，坚定不移地推进改革开放，坚持以人为本，树立全面、协调、可持续的发展观，统筹城乡发展，统筹区域发展，统筹经济社会发展，统筹人与自然和谐发展，统筹国内发展和对外开放，继续发展社会主义市场经济、社会主义民主政治和社会主义先进文化，促进经济社会和人的全面发展。&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
　　女士们、先生们！&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
　　台湾是中国不可分割的一部分。解决台湾问题，实现中国的完全统一，是全体中华儿女的共同心愿。台湾同胞和祖国大陆人民同根同源、血脉相连，是我们的骨肉兄弟。我们将坚持“和平统一、一国两制”的基本方针，尽最大努力实现中国的和平统一。我们坚决反对“台独”，绝不容许任何人以任何方式把台湾从中国分割出去。我们愿在一个中国原则基础上，同包括台湾同胞在内的海内外中华儿女一道，为实现中国的完全统一而共同努力。我们对法国坚持一个中国政策，反对台湾当局以“公投”为名推行“台独”的立场表示高度赞赏。&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
　　女士们、先生们！&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
　　和平与发展是当今时代的主题，世界多极化和经济全球化是不可阻挡的发展趋势。但是，今日之世界并不太平，单边主义有新的表现，恐怖主义危害加大，各种局部冲突和战争此起彼伏，传统安全因素和非传统安全因素相互交织，跨国犯罪日益猖獗，南北差距继续拉大。这些挑战和困难，需要各国人民共同应对。维护世界和平、促进共同发展，是中国外交政策的宗旨。中国将继续奉行独立自主的和平外交政策。我们主张国际关系民主化，通过对话和合作解决争端，世界上的事情应由各国平等协商，反对动辄使用武力或以武力相威胁。我们主张加强国际合作，消除贫困，保护环境，实现各国人民的共同发展。    和平是全人类最大的福祉。中华民族历来爱好和平。中国的发展有利于维护世界和平、促进共同发展。中国早就向世界庄严宣告，不论现在还是将来，中国永远不称霸，永远都是维护世界和平的坚定力量。&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
　　女士们、先生们！&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
　　历经半个多世纪的发展，欧盟已成为当今世界最大的和一体化程度最高的国家间组织。在欧盟建设的各个时期，法国都发挥了关键性作用。舒曼提出了“煤钢联营计划”，让·莫奈被誉为“欧共体之父”。中国支持欧盟一体化进程，希望欧盟在地区和国际事务中继续发挥积极作用。在法国等欧洲国家的推动下，中欧关系取得了很大发展。去年10月，中欧领导人第六次会晤在北京成功举行，双方一致同意发展中欧全面战略伙伴关系。中国愿在相互尊重、平等互利的基础上，进一步加强同欧盟和包括法国在内的欧盟成员国在各领域的对话和合作，推动双方关系长期稳定地向前发展。&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
　　最后，让我们共同努力，推动中法关系在新世纪里取得更大发展，为造福中法两国人民、为建设一个更加繁荣稳定的世界作出贡献。&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
　　谢谢各位。</description>

      <title>【看鉴中国】杭州余杭自来水发臭  居民质疑水务未及时预警  - 综合媒体</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m2ruzr</link>
      <description>余杭水务7月16日晚通报，7月16日上午，仁和街道及良渚街道部分区域出现自来水气味异常。 通报指13时30分出厂水水质恢复正常，每户将获得5吨水费的减免（港媒指约13-33元）。杭州水务客服人员称，原水波动导致嗅味异常，有异常的水进入了管网。

有中媒指，7月16日上午9时起，杭州市余杭区仁部分区域自来水出现明显异味。问题持续近15小时，直至当晚12点左右，仍有多个小区业主反映家中用水发臭。

中媒报道，有居民质疑水务未及时预警，从通报来看，他们上午已经知道，但直到晚上9点多才发通报，不少人已误用受污染的自来水做了晚餐，另有居民质疑，通报对人体健康影响及净水器滤芯损失等关键问题避而不谈。</description>

Yes, my Ubisoft account is linked to the PSN one. I played with my things between platforms multiple times now.</description>

      <description>don't get me wrong, it is absolutely okay to be bad at a game, especially a comp shooter. but im not talking about people who are bad at the game, im talking about bad players.

im talking the ones who pick healers to be selfish, or fraggers just to die in 15 seconds and blame you for not pushing with them.

im seriously so done with it. how many times have you been trying to get the win, but get screwed over by your braindead teammates. getting killed and leaving you in a 1v4 with no breach, no info, and no cover.

now you have to make the play of the century or get flamed for not clutching.

its not hard to be a good teammate, but its like theres a competition going for some of these stupid mfs to see who can piss you off in the least amount of time</description>
