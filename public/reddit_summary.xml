      <title>Please Help - Decision between TC500 and TR500 Speed Queen Washer</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1mc0oo2/please_help_decision_between_tc500_and_tr500/</link>
      <description>Basically the title. I’m going insane trying to decide what’s best. It doesn’t help that I’m the most indecisive person ever. We’ve been without a fully functioning washer for more than a week and it’s not sustainable. 

Everyone on Reddit seems to have varying opinions on these models with no real consensus. Both sides have valid concerns and both sides have loyalists. I just want something for my family that washes well, doesn’t destroy clothes, and will last a long time. Also, I cannot figure out the difference between the TR500 and 700. 

With the TC I see the beauty of its simplicity and lack of lid lock (the bane of my existence on our Maytag that came with the house and balancing) and the features of the TR, so I truly feel stuck. 

I’m also wondering about Speed Queen front loaders now but I know top loaders are traditionally more reliable. I’ll be getting a matching dryer because wife lol so I hope their dryers are as good. 

I’m not sure if anyone can really help me because I’m looking for a unicorn person who has owned both but seeing as they last a long time, maybe they don’t exist and that’s a good thing! 

Sorry for the dissertation—any help or advice would be greatly appreciated. 

Thank you! 😊</description>

      <title>Light weight Olukai sandals</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1mc67d2/light_weight_olukai_sandals/</link>
      <description>To all Olukai maxis out there. I really like the quality of this brand but i struggle to find something that is somehow comparable to a regular rubber flip flop in terms of weight. I've tried Ohana and Ulele and both are too heavy for my taste, it doesn't feel comfortable to walk in them. Unfortunately, I don't have an affiliated store close to me to visit and try all kind of versions.

Do you have any suggestions for a more light weight product of this brand?</description>

      <title>Men’s fashion brands</title>
      <link>https://i.redd.it/xx906uvh2sff1.jpeg</link>
      <description>Hi

I would like a more sustainable wardrobe and get real quality that lasts forever. What I typically wear is jeans with sneakers and t shirts or shirts. Relaxed dad with a “2007 hipster twist”, so flannel shirts, rugged overshirts in toned down colors, for example. I like the look of being well dressed without posh. Brands I could wear would be Patagonia, Levi’s, Lee, Carhartt , Clark’s, new balance.

Any recommendations for brands that are lasting long time and would likely fit my style ?
The picture could be an example of my style.

Thanks !!</description>

      <title>Are expensive phone cases actually worth it? Or is a cheap one just as good?</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1mc1r58/are_expensive_phone_cases_actually_worth_it_or_is/</link>
      <description>So I wanna get a new phone case that looks good. I was browsing on Amazon today and noticed the prices are *wild* – some are like a few bucks, others are like $50! I never really paid much attention to case prices before; I usually just bought whatever looked cute. So, what's the deal? Are the expensive ones genuinely better, or are they basically all the same? Maybe the pricier ones use higher quality materials? Anyone actually tested this? Should I just shell out for the expensive one?</description>

      <title>Recommendations for 10-15k daily steps walking shoes?</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1mbz6ko/recommendations_for_1015k_daily_steps_walking/</link>
      <description>I started a job recently training service dogs, and we walk about 10-15k steps per day. The company gives us a $100 stipend to buy walking shoes. I’m normally just in Chucks day-to-day but I’m interested in buying something that isn’t just going to get worn out and thrown away. I have flat feet from a foot surgery, and most “walking shoes” have so much excessive arch support it kills me. I want something with cushion, or that will mold to my feet, but with low arches. I’m looking into RedWing Chelseas maybe? I like that they slip on because we have to change shoes during the day and I don’t want to mess with a ton of laces. I just don’t know if the kinds of shoes I’m looking at are good for lots of daily urban walking. Anyone have any recommendations please?</description>

      <title>Eink Mp3 Player + Calender/Reminders?</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1mbdpmk/eink_mp3_player_calenderreminders/</link>
      <description>Hi all,

I've been considering switching to an Eink phone for a while, but think I've whittled down what I actually need, and it isn't a phone.

I'm wondering what my best options are for an eink device that I can use primarily as an MP3 player and for calendar/reminders? 

I know things like the Boox Palma and the Hisense A9 exist, but they're a bit pricey (I had the Hisense A9 running LineageOS but found it very large and heavy so sold it).  
I'm open to a Mudita Kompakt if I can get one at a good price and just not put a sim card into it.

Maybe those 3 are the best available options, but if there are others I'd love to know.

Thanks!</description>

      <title>e-ink vs iPad for building a second brain, in searchable text form</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1mbmwiz/eink_vs_ipad_for_building_a_second_brain_in/</link>
      <description>So I'm currently looking to set up a knowledge base or the much mentioned "second brain" some people have. I'm a bit torn between going for an iPad and an e-ink tablet. Current thinking is the Supernote Manta looks like the most likely option for what I need, with the organisation features.

So the main pros of a digital device in general is the ability to store, tag and search documents and ideas for the long haul. I have considered using something like Obsidian to bring all my various notepads together. However I work (like many people) on a screen all day and as such I feel that I get enough screentime as it is.

I have so many notebooks strewn across the place, and the one thing I basically never do is convert them into some sort of indexable, useful knowledge. So the idea of either an app or a device that would help pull this all together and organise is very appealing. I also have temporary notes such as daytime checklists for work that could work well digitised.

iPad would give me the ability to take notes, and as a bonus do things like email, or even digital art or other fun hobby stuff. I'd feel confident enough to create focus modes for when the need to note strikes. The other plus for the iPad is that if the note-taking habit doesn't stick, the device has other utilities. But that feeling of yet another glass screen is the main thing holding me back. While those extra bells and whistles would be fun, the main outcome of getting the tablet would be using it around the house and on the desk for writing, organising and going back through old notes.

For around 2/3 the cost (Supernote has a hefty import tax to the UK, but it's still cheaper than a well-specced iPad and Apple Pencil Pro) Supernote has a simplified workflow and focussed approach. I like the idea of just doodling on this after hours, so I can break off from the blue light and have notes on a device that is digitised, but avoids the trappings of the screen. I recognise that e-ink isn't perfect from owning a Kindle a while back, and I know there's some debate about the varying quality of the writing experience.

Is this a clear cut case for the e-ink device, or have I missed something here? Has anyone had to pick between these and chosen one way or the other for building a knowledge base of all their old notes? Interested to hear from anyone who has run these devices longer term and has some reflections on their choice.</description>

      <description>Users are unable to make new posts on the Mobiscribe subreddit. Whatever the reason for that, there's still no doubt some users around like myself who now or at some point will have things they'd like to discuss regarding their devices.

&amp;nbsp;

I figured I'd make a general thread here that might show up when people are googling "mobiscribe (problem) reddit" or whatever. 

&amp;nbsp;

I have a new B&amp;W Wave. So far enjoying it a lot, incredible value at $99. One issue I'm having is passive battery drain is a little more than I'd like, if any users have any advice on that, maybe there's some software tweaks?</description>

      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1mbnf6u/bigme_hibreak_pro_permission_controller_app_keeps/</link>
      <description>The permission controller app on my Bigme Hibreak Pro crashes on every boot, reboot and several times throughout the day, usually when I'm changing permissions for apps (camera use, location use, accessibility use, etc.). AV app and autofill app (Bitwarden) need accessibility privileges and it keeps messing with those every crash. I'm running Android 14 and This only started after a major system update (2.4.2) &amp; consequent smaller security one (200-300MB). I have been using CCleaner to optimize apps/system and have disabled/frozen a few I'll never use (not Android system or Google services apps). Phone is not rooted. Anyone else having this issue?

      <title>3-Color Eink panels CAN update quickly</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1mbedbh/3color_eink_panels_can_update_quickly/</link>
      <description>I've been researching the inner workings of Eink panels for the last year or so and have created various libraries to drive them (bb\_epaper and FastEPD). For the last week I've been creating custom LUTs (look up tables) for the UltraChip UC81xx controller to bring new functionality to 1-bit (Black/White) displays. I found a Black/White/Red UC81xx panel in my collection so I decided to start experimenting with additional functionality on these panels. Normally 3-color Eink displays take 13-25 seconds to update. In the video you can see a 1.5 second fast black/white mode that I created.

Now I need to figure out how the Solomon Systech SSD16xx LUTs work :)</description>

      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1mbugh9/how_really_is_an_eink_phone/</link>
      <description>Hello, I am a 21yrs old (m) and I am addicted to screen (either phone or laptop) but want to work in cybersecurity. Since people who works in IT field generally spend a lot of time on computer or laptop screen so I think having an e-ink phone or laptop would be better because I heard that they do not emit blue light.
So I was thinking about switching from my actual phone to an e-ink phone, because this community focus on talking about e-ink phone so I would like to know what would be the best recommandation ? The advantages and the downsides of them? Are they expensive ? If yes do they worth buying them?

Thanks for taking your time to read it, any comment is welcome(I am English learner so sorry if you don't understand some part of my text).</description>

      <description>由于中国就台湾总统赖清德的访问向华盛顿提出异议，川普政府已阻止其在前往中美洲途中经停纽约。以下是我们对美国这一决定的了解。

赖清德原计划于 8 月经美国前往承认台湾的巴拉圭、危地马拉和伯利兹。但据三位知情人士透露，美国告知赖清德，他无法在途中访问纽约。赖清德办公室昨天发表声明称，由于台湾正在从最近的台风中恢复，且台北正在与美国就关税问题进行谈判，赖清德近期没有出国旅行的计划。 

知情人士称，他之所以决定不去纽约，是因为他被告知不被允许前往纽约。</description>

      <title>为什么我对日本没有深仇大恨</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/China_irl/comments/1mc2zi5/为什么我对日本没有深仇大恨/</link>
      <description>首先叠个甲，我认为日本在二战中的暴行确实非常可怕，值得谴责。

问题来了，中国目前普遍流行的对日本的仇恨有道理吗？我认为没有。因为我认为没有仇恨日本人的理由。

我就按照粉红以牙还牙，以眼还眼的逻辑来看吧。如果按照这个逻辑，那么可就吓人了。应该仇恨的民族可就太多了。比如说满族，当年清朝打天下的时候杀了好几千万汉人，绝对比日本人杀的还多。镇压太平天国又杀了几千万人。比如说回族汉族当年陕甘回乱的时候互杀，杀了数百万人。比如共产党自己搞的各种运动，例如文革，还有三年大饥荒。死的人也比日本人多。按照粉红的逻辑，中国人也应该仇恨满族，回族，以及共产党。（ps：我上学的时候就听说过很多人吹曾国藩，说他是什么半个圣人。同是战犯，风评真的是一个天一个地）。

如果按照对大屠杀的反思来看，日本目前我认为还是及格水准的。回族，维族，以及满族我没看到他们对大屠杀有什么大的反思。反而他们还因为少数民族获得各种特权。东南亚各国不仅不反思屠华，至今很多国家依然对中国人有歧视政策，中国人也不恨。

最最可笑的是俄罗斯族。俄罗斯族以任何视角来看都是标准的殖民者和侵略者。俄罗斯族造成的屠杀后果不可谓不严重，直接杀尽了外东北的中国人，强占了外东北。然而俄罗斯族如今也被算作五十六个民族之一，被各种团结。为什么要把历史上多次屠杀中国人，数量极其稀少，而且和中国没有太多文化认同的俄罗斯族算作五十六个民族之一，我也不明白。

如果要找一个仇恨对象，我觉得凭心而论，日本人甚至都排不到前三名。</description>

      <description>按流行的一句话，他不是知道错了，而是快要死了。当然没有快要死了这么严重，至少也说明中国新生儿下降速度太快了，中国人民产出新的牛马速度不够了，共产党担心以后没有牛马可以进行剥削压迫了。不到万不得已，共产党会给老百姓发钱吗？

汽车置换补贴，国补省补区补全套下来大概不到四万，一个孩子三年补贴一万多，换算下来一辆车=三个孩子。

这个补贴能不能确保发下去也很难说，很多地方工资都发不起了，很难不被挪用。

习近平统治时期，中国的新生儿下降超过一半了，这个必然会青史留名。</description>

      <title>日本对中国的仇恨</title>
      <link>https://www.keguanjp.com/kgjp_jish/kgjp_jish/pt20241210000013.html</link>
      <description>首先来看看联合民调。就算到今天，中国对日本没有好印象的人也比日本对中国没有好印象的人占比较低。

且这个数据并不是因为什么中国移民，旅游啊改变的，恰恰就是因为一个钓鱼岛，日本人突然爱国精神就上来了，全民开始敌视中国。可以说日本政府的洗脑比中国政府强多了，这上来之后就再也没下去过。

日本人对战争的反思可以说是零，最经常被日本人关注的是原子弹，隔三差五还上个热搜，批判一下美国人没有人性，丝毫不提为什么会被扔原子弹。

经常被拿来说事儿的中国人嘲笑日本的天灾。但日本人一样干，就这两天这个北京暴雨，也一堆日本人在评论区冷嘲热讽。

就这么一个民族，这么一个国家，到现在还嚷嚷着台湾有事就是日本有事。有的人却要求中国人大度，拍个电影都要被说煽动仇恨，是否有点？</description>

      <title>Attacker Op Idea?</title>
      <link>https://i.redd.it/72xgervdrrff1.jpeg</link>
      <description>Got bored late at night so I just thought about all the Serbian Siege players rn (Including me) who would, probably, want a SAJ-based Operator🇷🇸
Ubisoft already did "Osa" and she is Croatian, So I see this being possible...??..If the head dev catches on. Me personally I think its not any mind blowing or crazy idea, But it would be heavily appreciated by the Serbian playerbase..Though I could see "him" get loved by the whole world too, Since they dont look ordinary, But I guess..kinda unique?..Ill pop like 1 or 2 pics here just to show what they look like.✌️✌️ (Oh also, Im not even sure what could his ability be? But if this EVER gets thought about, Im pretty sure Ubisoft will handle the thinking😭)</description>

      <description>Almost every game in diamond and champ has a cheater. And I’m not just complaining as I get elo back almost every day. Why should we even play if cheaters own the game?</description>

      <title>Update 2 hacked account</title>
      <link>https://i.redd.it/g8zuj8du9off1.jpeg</link>
      <description>So, as you can see in my other post, my account has been hacked some time ago. After trying to find a solution with Ubisoft to Noah Phil, I decided to contact them again for like the 60th time. This time threatening with legal action. Meanwhile, I also made a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. Luckily, when I made the legal threat, an actual human being reviewed my case and helped me. I just now also got a message back from the Better Business Bureau and I got a response through there as well. As you can see, I highly recommend everyone that has problems regarding with Ubisoft to do the same thing I did. I really hope this helps anyone out there with any problems that I had as well.</description>
