      <description>Wool, leather, and canvas
             ‚ÄîOR‚Äî
Nylon, down, and Gore-tex

If I were to breakdown winter/outdoor clothing into these two categories, would that make sense to everyone? I‚Äôve been down both roads and can‚Äôt seem to determine which path I prefer. They both had distinct advantages. 

Which path would you recommend for someone looking to create a minimalist layering system for winter outdoor use that fits the BIFL mantra?</description>

      <title>Help my mom fix or replace her Bernina sewing machine, please!</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1m2qmd2/help_my_mom_fix_or_replace_her_bernina_sewing/</link>
      <description>My mom (70-80 y.o. range) is a huge sewer and suilter. She's about to have a major surgery that leaves her with reading and seeing as options during recovery....and her machine just quit (again). I need help with ideas for either the current machine or a replacement (and where to get it). 

My mom has her original machine that she got herself way back when. As mentioned, recently, she's had issues with her machine so got a spare on eBay and now that's not right. I'm sharing the info she gave me here below. 

Again, I'm sharing this to see if anyone can suggest ideas of where to go (or what to look into), or an alternative, modern version to just buy. She doesn't want all the bells and whistles, electronics, many machines have today. 

Thank you for any ideas! 

Her info:

"Bernina 830 Record, made in Switzerland.  Purchased 1975.  The light does work.  The pedal plug does go in, but the pedal does not work, no matter how strongly you press on it.  This was serviced one month ago.  At first it was fine, then stopped in the middle of a seam.

Backup (from eBay) Bernina 830.  Also a mechanical machine.  The light does not turn on and the pedal doesn't work.

I do know that the cord number is usually 329.164.04    The pedal number is 325.213.14; type 323.

These machines are both from the 1970s and do not have all the fancy electronics of today.  All metal machines.

I am the only person who has ever used my 830 Record.  They have been serviced three times in the last two years.  Each time they worked for a while, but never just completely stopped."</description>

      <title>Made a little tool to help me find practical, durable, and quality products people actually like (not sponsored stuff)</title>
      <link>http://buydit.org</link>
      <description>So‚Ä¶ I have a bit of a decision problem. I kept finding myself deep in Reddit threads for anything I buy trying to figure out which products people actually like, without getting lost in fake reviews or ‚Äúinfluencer‚Äù noise.

Anyway, I hacked together this little site called¬†[Buydit.org](https://buydit.org/)¬†‚Äî it basically searches Reddit for product mentions and shows you stuff that‚Äôs been talked about positively. No ads, no tracking, no fluff. Just vibes and upvotes.

I mostly built it for myself, but figured it might be useful for others here too. Totally free. No signups or anything. Just type in like ‚Äúcruelty-free skincare‚Äù or ‚ÄúMotorcycle bluetooth system‚Äù and it‚Äôll dig through posts for you.

Would love feedback if you try it ‚Äî or not, that‚Äôs cool too. Thanks for reading üôÉ</description>

      <title>Women‚Äôs underwear similar in fit to aerie sizes</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1m2pm88/womens_underwear_similar_in_fit_to_aerie_sizes/</link>
      <description>Hi all I have not posted in this subreddit before, but have been a lurker for a while. I come with a conundrum.

I (32F) am a short short queen. I am under 5 foot and not even 95 pounds soaking wet. I have a very square shaped body and essentially have a similar body to a 12-year-old boy.

So far in my life , since I was a teen, the only underwear that I could find that would fit me and look remotely flattering were the xxs size of underwear at aerie. 

I‚Äôve come to the point that I really want to stop buying their underwear. My favorite kind : French cut bikini type, have degraded in quality so intensely that new ones can only get a few months of wear out of them before they become see-through and have holes.
They are fast fashion and quite frankly I hate supporting them.

The problem is, I can‚Äôt find anything similar that I like the fit of  ( French cut but not high waisted) or the comfortability (all cotton with a little spandex) that actually makes underwear small enough for my butt. 
I kid you not, extra smalls or even XXS in other brands, fall off my butt. 

Does anyone know of a brand that fits some of these criteria that I should try?</description>

      <title>A list of BIFL not made in the USA</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1igl1ab/a_list_of_bifl_not_made_in_the_usa/</link>
      <description>A timely reminder that this subreddit is obviously very USA-centric with its recommendations as that‚Äôs where the majority of users are from. It often leads to people not realising that comparable and/or better items can be found closer to home, easier, cheaper and free of tolls.

I thought it would be a good idea to crowdsource some manufacturers here for non-American users.

This isn't neccesarily items made in those countries as some manufacturers use factories across the world but with a commitment to quality

I can start (I'm kind of UK/Euro centric so it would be great to expand this):

**Clothing**  
Portuguese Flannel - Portugal  
Naked and Famous - Canada  
Uskees - UK   
Yarmouth Oilskins - UK  
Carrier Company - UK  
Old Town - UK (Closing down)  
Farmer's Market - Iceland (may be hard to buy outside of Iceland)  
Oni Denim - Japan  
Iron Heart - Japan  
Barbour - UK  
Companion - Spain  
N√ÑZ¬†- Portugal (only women)  
Meindl - Germany (they run a high quality fashion brand but are known for great hiking boots)

**Outdoor Gear**  
Fj√§llr√§ven¬†- Sweden  
Rab - UK (offer a very good repair service)  
66¬∞ North - Iceland  
Devold - Norway  
Bergans- Norway  
Hagl√∂fs¬†- Sweden  
Kl√§ttermusen - Sweden  
Alpkit - UK

**Footwear**  
Solovair - UK  
Mayura Boots - Spain  
Church's - UK  
Loake - UK  
Wm. Lennon - UK  
Astorflex - Italy

**Kitchen/Cookware**  
Le Cresuet - France  
De Buyer - France  
Fissler - Germany  
WMF - Germany (very wide and variable range but Made in Germany stuff good)  
Fiskars - Finland  
Duralex - France  
Samuel Groves - UK

**Appliances/Small appliances**  
Miele - Germany  
Dualit - UK  
Moccamaster - Netherlands (Coffee makers)  
Zojirushi¬†- Japan  
Numatic - UK (vacuum cleaners)  
Sebo - Germany (vacuum cleaners)  
Ankarsarum - Sweden

Edit - Some excellent feedback. I'll try and work my way through and add what I can! Please note that I will only add stuff that I have experience with but all the comments help with crowd sourcing knowledge.</description>

Edit: Adding some other brands up here that I personally own and love.

Canada West Boots - Made in Winnipeg. Been wearing a pair of Romeos for a couple years now.

Popov Leather - Made in Nelson, BC. have a few of their leather goods, holding up really well.

Meyer - PEI. High quality made in Canada pots and pans, I have their non-stick 12‚Äù.</description>

      <title>My take on the Kindle Scribe vs. Boox Note Air4 C</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1m13ak5/my_take_on_the_kindle_scribe_vs_boox_note_air4_c/</link>
      <description>I wanted to share my thoughts on the Kindle Scribe vs. Boox Note Air4 C for anyone having as much trouble choosing between the two as I did.

**What I was looking for**

I already have the greatest ereader of all time -- the Kindle Oasis 10th Gen -- which I use for most of my reading at home and while traveling. I had a few Amazon gift cards and wanted to find a complement to:

* Continue reading Kindle books on my train commute
* Read and markup learning materials: I'm a software engineer and frequently read academic papers, engineering blogs / newsletters, course note PDFs, etc.
* Take planner style notes and jot down ideas as they come to me during the day
* (Maybe) tackle some basic work items: provide feedback on Google / Notion docs, respond to quick emails, make quick wire frames, etc. (anything in this category would be a bonus)

**Kindle Scribe**

I got the Scribe first as a prime day deal: \~$320 for a 32GB model bundled with the premium pen and leather case.

What I like about the Scribe:

* Great screen. I have good light on my commute and at my desk, and don't even have to think about using the frontlight.
* When the pen hits the screen, it works exactly they way you'd want it to: it feels great, markup appears right away, underline text works perfectly, etc.
* The button on the stylus is well implemented and lets you switch between the pen and highlighter (or whatever you want to configure it to instantly).
* Being able to make a note by just writing on a Kindle book and having text flow around it is wonderful.
* Palm rejection is well implemented. I've only had a few instances where my palm caused an issue
* Classic Kindle borderline infinite battery
* Despite being locked into an ecosystem, it's really easy to get stuff to a Kindle: PDFs via [Send to Kindle](https://www.amazon.com/sendtokindle), Substack or newspaper articles via the Safari share menu, email newsletters via [Newsletter to Kindle](https://newslettertokindle.com/), etc. Boox isn't bad on this front, but sometimes takes an extra conversion step from a webpage.
* The premium stylus is nice.

What I don't like:

* You have to manually change between landscape and portrait mode. I prefer to read my Kindle books in landscape orientation with two columns. All of my notetaking and learning oriented reading is done in portrait orientation. So on a typical day I: read in landscape on the train, swap it to portrait mode for work, swap it back to landscape for my commute home, and (maybe) swap it back to portrait for studying / planning for the next day at home. Each time I need to go into the Kindle settings, find the layout menu, toggle the layout mode, and wait a few seconds for the content to reformat. Only takes 5-10 seconds, but super annoying that I have to do it so much.
* Switching between documents takes longer than on the Boox, especially when you have a few documents open in Neo Reader and can use the tabs.
* Lacks a lot of the features the Boox has: color, AI integrations, advanced note taking features like perfect shapes, etc.

**Boox Note Air4 C**

The Boox was $509 on Amazon (needed the return policy).  The premium stylus was another $70 and the case another $50, so close to $700 with tax. Considerably more expensive, but a price I'd be willing to pay for a color e reader that checks all my boxes.

What I like about the Air4 C:

* Color! It's really nice having color. Color communicates a lot of information in charts and figures, and on that front the Boox communicates information more efficiently than the Kindle. I knew the screen would be darker, but this alone wasn't a deal breaker for me. In my normal lighting conditions, I can get away without the front light. A touch of grain, but no real complaints on text clarity.
* Navigation: switching between docs feels quicker to me on the Boox. I can easily tab between my planner &amp; a paper I'm reading in Neo Reader, and then swap over to the Kindle app which has my personal reading open. Generally two taps on the Boox to switch recent docs vs. three on the Scribe.
* Adjusting portrait / landscape layout is as easy as rotating the device.
* AI features: selecting text, asking AI a question about it, copying the output, and then saving that output as a note on the highlighted text is a **dream** workflow for learning.
* PDF display options: document mode, reflow, etc.
* Split screen note taking: honestly don't see myself using it much (it makes the content small), but nice to have.
* Scribble to erase is really useful
* Ability to export PDFs with notes easily
* Advanced note taking: colors, perfect shapes, lots of pen options, fill tool, tons of templates (including custom ones if you want)
* Gestures: being able to quickly adjust the frontlight, refresh the screen, go back etc. is really nice.
* Android &amp; customizability: I have an Android phone, I love menu diving, tinkering with my NeoVim config, etc. I like having so many options app availability.

What I don't like:

* Underline to highlight [doesn't work](https://www.reddit.com/r/Onyx_Boox/comments/1ftgdi8/highlighting_with_smart_scribe/) for text spanning multiple lines. This is my main interaction with a text when active reading, and works so well on the Scribe. The workarounds I figured out are:
   * Underline one line, and then use the little highlight tab to expand to the other words I want. A little finicky, and much slower than underlining multiple lines would take.
   * Highlight with finger. It's annoying having to switch between the stylus and my finger, and my finger is too imprecise with small text.
   * Switch the stylus out of writing mode so I can long press to highlight. From there I can add a handwritten note if I want. This is the best multiline highlighting experience, but then to use the stylus as a pen again it takes multiple clicks (open the sidebar menu, open the pen settings, put the stylus back in writing mode). Reverse when I'm done.
* Screen is dimmer. I did my research and knew to expect this. It's not *that* bad -- I could live without the front light most of the time, but to get the most out of the colors, you need it on. And compared to the Scribe, the Boox looks much more obviously lit with the front light on, which partially defeats the purpose of eink for me.
* Palm rejection is much worse. This isn't a huge issue in Neo Reader where you can configure limited areas for turning the page and opening the settings (I used option 6), but it's a major issue in the Kindle app: I can't put my palm down when I highlight with the stylus without opening the page navigation interface. Obviously Kindle is going to better on a Kindle, but this is a near unusable experience for what will be one of my most common workflows.. Also, you can't use the AI workflow mentioned above in the Kindle app, because it's a Neo Reader-specific feature.
* Slightly worse writing experience: worse feel, slight perceptible lag between pen down and writing appearing vs. the Scribe
* Worse battery: not a dealbreaker for me. Still enough for me to do everything I want on it for several days.
* Default stylus: bad, plastic-y
* App experience wasn't good enough for other stuff: for serious writing, I'm still going to want a keyboard, for managing Notion, I'm going to want a high screen refresh rate, for making wireframes, I'm going to use Figma. I'm going to pick the best tool for a job, and despite all the functionality, the Boox isn't it for a lot of jobs.
* [Reports](https://www.reddit.com/r/Onyx_Boox/comments/19czc16/a_general_warning_about_boox_boox_tablets_boox/) of bad customer service for devices that often break out of the blue scare me with a device that's so expensive.

**Photos**

Sorry for the weird angle, was trying to avoid glare. Good light coming from an exterior window with frosted privacy glass behind me. Focused more on the Boox; you can trust that the Scribe screen is good.

[No front light, Boox left, Scribe right](https://preview.redd.it/zarceuuxt5df1.jpg?width=4080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=262d1463f5b6674fac620e07555c232e74796ee9)

[Front lights on high, Scribe is more of a natural white; Boox feels more like an OLED screen](https://preview.redd.it/k0dgab8wu5df1.jpg?width=4080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a690dd00b70c972ad10de2955d4db018d3937ed0)

[Boox close up no light](https://preview.redd.it/f02c5o6dv5df1.jpg?width=3072&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0bd0b39c4c0cbd4c81a80531fb2ff8179a3d4886)

[Boox close up: front light on](https://preview.redd.it/yefaahhiv5df1.jpg?width=2987&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1ccf59512e5b3cf0f6dfe50489ce2948d08be11)

**The Verdict**

I'm keeping the Kindle and returning the Boox. Neither device is perfect, and I love some of what Boox is doing, but the Scribe nails the core interactions for my use cases (portrait vs. landscape issue aside), which is more important to me than the functionality around the edges. Throw in great battery life, reliable build quality, and that it's half the price, it wasn't *that* hard of a decisions.

Fingers crossed that one day there'll be a great color eink tablet that easily pulls in everything I want to read, integrates a note taking experience with my Google Calendar and Notion task list, has a seamless AI integration, etc., but until then I'm happy to stay in reliable, albeit limited, Kindle land.</description>

      <title>System update for my Penstar E-Note</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1m1xhdq/system_update_for_my_penstar_enote/</link>
      <description>Booted up my Penstar E-Note after not using it for a month or so, and lo and behold, it informs me of a system update.

Was quite surprised since I hadn‚Äôt seen any updates  since I had purchased it back in December of last year.

Will post if I find anything interesting.

Now really wish Penstar would get on the ball and release the new tablets they showed off at CES2025 back in February.

I get it, China is a financial and business mess right now, so any new electronics devices may end up dying on the vine due to lack of available manufacturers, but a person can still hope.</description>

      <title>Go 7 vs Tab Mini C performance ?</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1m1zdlv/go_7_vs_tab_mini_c_performance/</link>
      <description>So I previously had a Tab Mini C and sold it - I initially bought it thinking it would be useful for reading academic papers and taking notes but frankly the size was just not practical, and the neo reader app while trying its best, sucked at reflowing pdfs to read. Note taking was well not spacious for sharing half a page with a pdf. Though by itself, the note taking worked just fine. It was also a bit heavy for its size, and frankly, the colour sscreen sucked 

I do realize by the time i bought the tab mini c earlier this year, it was already a dated device

I had Nexus 7 for the longest time that just died, so I'm missing a small tablet.

  
Ive tempered my expectations, so I just want an eink device that I can use to not only read,but use to take notes reliably.

  
This time it'll just be for note taking, so thats enough real estate for me ( I read from a pc or a printed paper and scribe my notes on to the device ) 

  
So for anyone who has tried both devices, are there notable differences with the performance ?</description>

I'll be in *Zh√®jiƒÅng* province, and will most likely travel to whatever big cities that are relatively close (definitely Shanghai). Any official stores, Tech Malls, whatever stores or other places that may carry them are very welcome in the replies.</description>

      <title>Best E-ink Phones Exclusively for Reading</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1m215aj/best_eink_phones_exclusively_for_reading/</link>
      <description>I have a Samsung S23 Ultra and a Kindle Paperwhite 5 (I think?).  I'm looking to get a secondary phone that's used exclusively for reading e-mail newsletters, substack, pdf, and epubs on the go. 

I'll still be using my Samsung as my main phone, and maybe a Kindle for when I want a simulated book reading experience. 

The thing is, my eyes hurt from using my phone too much. On the other hand, my Kindle doesn't fit in many of the bags I use daily. I also find it limiting at times since the interface is pretty wonky for most online websites (I'm getting into reading online magazines lately.) 

I heard about e-ink phones, and I am interested in the whole "e-ink hurts my eyes less" feature. But I wanna hear from actual e-ink phone users about what their experience was like with this type of phone. 

  
1. Now that you have an e-ink phone, what are some of the things you wish you knew before buying? 

2. Do you think they're heavy for long reading sessions? Screen and font size too small or just right? Think 3-4 hours. 

3. Would getting one primarily as a reading device be worth the price? The phones I'm looking at are around the $200 - $400 range, but do let me know if there are better phones for better prices out there.</description>

      <title>Bigme Hibreak Pro worked yesterday, no longer works today</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1m2aral/bigme_hibreak_pro_worked_yesterday_no_longer/</link>
      <description>Hello everyone,

This morning, my Hibreak Pro got stuck on the startup screen: the BIGME logo with the letters flashing one after the other in a loop. He was in charge all night as usual.

Here's what I tried:

* Recovery mode + forced shutdown
* Force restart by holding the power button. But nothing works ‚Äî it's still stuck on the flashing logo.

Luckily I had an old phone I could fall back on, but I'm really disappointed. I had high hopes for this device.

I have two questions:

1. The phone contains important work-related data from the past few days. Is there any way to access it via USB in its current state?
2. Is there a method to restart the phone without doing a full reset?</description>

      <title>Is there an e-ink tablet that is good for authors trying to write/organize a book?</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1m2fhhq/is_there_an_eink_tablet_that_is_good_for_authors/</link>
      <description>I love the concept of using an e-ink tablet to write a book. However, the software on both the remarkable 2 and kindle scribe are lacking.  I am looking for something that can search handwritten text (preferably without converting it). Something that allows you to organize a book (for example, allowing headlines with hyperlinks to a side menu). And something that has seamless integration with your computer (and perhaps phone). Can any e-ink tablets do this?  Any authors out there use an e-ink tablet to write part of a book? Ideally, I would like to switch between typing on my laptop and handwriting on a tablet.</description>

      <description>I recently ordered a Dasung Paperlike 103 and got this email from them.

Basically due to US tariffs, I have to pay an extra fee to get my monitor. To be honest, I don‚Äôt know if i would have bought the monitor if i knew about it.

Just wanted to know if anyone in the US has received this email. 

Also, what is the average time people until they receive their item?</description>

      <title>Need a recommendation for an 8‚Äù e-reader</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1m2sjtt/need_a_recommendation_for_an_8_ereader/</link>
      <description>I‚Äôm looking for suggestions/opinions/recommendations for an e-reader with a screen close to 8 inches. My wife has a kobo libra color and I find that the 7 inch screen is a little small for my liking. 

Other things that I‚Äôm looking for are:

-Black and white screen; color is nice but I don‚Äôt really need it

-Stylus support - I‚Äôm looking to be able to take notes or do some light design/sketching, so this is fairly important

-Good battery life

-Priced between $250-350 including the cost of the stylus if it doesn‚Äôt come with one

I‚Äôm looking forward to hear what you all think would be a good fit for me!</description>

      <description>They are run by Good e reader, a 3rd party reseller, not by Bigme/Hisense. They popularized the incorrect A9 pro term, which is just referring to the 8 GB/256 GB model, not a separate device like the A5/A5 pro.</description>

Disclosure: This news has only been released in Chinese so we don‚Äôt have the full information of these e-ink devices yet. They will be released in China only for now (specifically on 15 April 2025) and will come to the international markets later on.  
‚Åù  
The Mira Pro Color is a¬†**25.3 inch**¬†e-ink color monitor and will also use Kaleido 3. It‚Äôll be interesting to see how it compares to the Revo monitors from Dasung. It will cost 9499 yuan which comes to around¬†**1300$**.</description>

      <title>I hate bad players</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/1m2pltg/i_hate_bad_players/</link>
      <description>don't get me wrong, it is absolutely okay to be bad at a game, especially a comp shooter. but im not talking about people who are bad at the game, im talking about bad players.

im talking the ones who pick healers to be selfish, or fraggers just to die in 15 seconds and blame you for not pushing with them.

im seriously so done with it. how many times have you been trying to get the win, but get screwed over by your braindead teammates. getting killed and leaving you in a 1v4 with no breach, no info, and no cover.

now you have to make the play of the century or get flamed for not clutching.

its not hard to be a good teammate, but its like theres a competition going for some of these stupid mfs to see who can piss you off in the least amount of time</description>

Yes, my Ubisoft account is linked to the PSN one. I played with my things between platforms multiple times now.</description>
