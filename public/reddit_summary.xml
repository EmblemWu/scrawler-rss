      <description>J C Penney - Penncraft lifetime Warranty

I came across a set of JCP Penncraft Sockets. One was cracked, but in it's rightful place in it's box. i decided to have some fun at jcpenney.

I took the tool to the Customer Service Department, the man looked at me like I had suddenly grew a second head, and it had caught fire. he listened to my story, took the tool, made a phone call, and to my surprise told me that they no longer carry those tools. Before I had a chance to protest, he told me that I could buy a similar tool, bring in the receipt with the broken tool, and they would pay for the replacement.

While I was tempted to buy off the tool truck, i simply sent to Lowe's, bought a CM socket, and was promptly paid for the replacement.

Great Customer Service for a company that hasn't sold tools in over 40 years.</description>

      <description>My best friend is moving away, I want to buy him a going away gift that will be a nice quality of life upgrade for him. Physically small since he is limited on moving space. His main hobby is video games on his computer, so I was hoping to get him something related to gaming, or just a general life improving item. Thank you in advance!</description>

      <title>Wow, so many of my clearance rack items from 20+ years ago are still going strong.</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1m9y9fo/wow_so_many_of_my_clearance_rack_items_from_20/</link>
      <description>Hey all, hope you're having a good weekend! I'm getting back into shape and decluttering stuff that doesn't fit anymore. Trying everything on has been shocking. All the stuff in my closet is either 20+ years old or less than 3. But the older items are way better (not fading, pilling, etc.) than the newer things, even though my newer things are from supposedly higher quality stores/brands.

Everything older is from back when I could only afford to shop clearance at  Ross or JCPenney. My favorite long sleeve button up from Arizona Jean Company is 20 years old but the collar and sleeves haven't stretched out, lost their shape, or faded. Meanwhile, the Banana Republic button up is only three years old and so faded it looks grey now (originally was green!). Both 100% cotton.

Even stuff that was considered cheap back then has held up. I have three chunky statement necklaces from the early days of Charming Charlie (clearance, ~$3 each) and they are still getting worn frequently, without any chipping, flaking, tarnishing. But  the J Crew necklace I bought two years ago (end of season sale, ~$40) has broken so many times it's half the original length because I have to keep removing links when I fix it.

Maybe I'm just being old, but it seems like the quality of everything actually did used to be better?</description>

      <title>Women's clothing brands?</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1ma4dhe/womens_clothing_brands/</link>
      <description>I'm nearly 40, post maternity, and I need a wardrobe refresh. I'm mostly looking for clothes a can look professional in while remaining comfortable as I teach high school. 

I hate shopping so, so much, but over the years, it's gotten so much worse. The quality of former "good" brands is so terrible that I can feel it. I hear threads pop as I try on "stretchy" items such as swimwear. It's infuriating! 

I need some basics, and I don't want them to be trash by next year (or even buy the spring). I'm willing to pay extra for quality, sustainably-made clothing that will last.

I didn't see any pinned posts for women's clothing brands. Any suggestions? If it matters, I'm in Houston, Texas, but I'll purchase online it there's a decent return policy (because clothes and women's bodies, let's face it, they often don't play nicely).</description>

      <title>I compared the best ice makers</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1magaac/i_compared_the_best_ice_makers/</link>
      <description>My family has been looking to get an ice maker for a long time and this summer it just has to happen. To get as much info as possible and because I have way too much free time, I compared the best ice makers online and compiled this list. I’m sharing it here if someone else might find it useful:

GE Profile Opal 2.0 (\~$500-$600) - favorite among serious ice fans - crunchy Sonic-style nugget ice; takes about 10 minutes for first batch, \~38 lb a day; if you clean it monthly and use distilled water say it works for years; it's the only one people seem to actually love long-term

\*if you skip cleanings, the internal lines get slimy fast

Cowsar (\~$68) - fast and compact; chewable nugget ice; first batch in 5-6 minutes, 26.5lb/day, good ice texture, quick

\*early failures - fans grinding, sensors breaking, or it just dying after a few months; good when it works, but definitely a gamble

GoveeLife (\~$121) - makes bullet ice, about 26 lb/day, first batch in 6–8 minutes; you can start/stop it with an app, it gives cleaning alerts; pretty quiet; easy to clean;

Frigidaire (\~$80) - bullet ice, \~26 lb/day, first batch in 7-8 min, 5-6 mins for the next ones; kinda loud operation; works fine if you clean it every couple of weeks;

Euhomy (\~$71) - about 26 lb/day, first batch in 6-8 mins; bullet or nugget style depending on the model; reliable if you use filtered/distilled water and clean it occasionally; quieter and a bit better built than Frigidaire

\*Silonn is basically a rebranded Euhomy, so if one’s cheaper, go for that

Silonn (\~$65) - pretty much the same as Euhomy - same build, same output, same reliability, so just get whichever one’s on sale

TLDR: best investments are GE Profile Opal 2.0 and GoveeLife, but whichever one you choose, you must clean it AT LEAST once monthly + use distilled water if you want it to last long term</description>

      <title>Wilson Sunglasses. 1930 to present</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ma1z58</link>
      <description>I have 6 pairs of Wilson glasses, all from the early 1900s to WW2.  They are comfortable and stay in place with cable temples.  The most magnificent part is the lens.  They have an amazing amber.  It's somewhere between a brown and a yellow with a little green thrown in.  They're dark enough to handle a sunny day and light enough to wear to dinner.  Then there's old glass.  There's an organic quality to the view that a new lens purposely avoids.  The beauty, however, is in the imperfections.</description>

      <title>Help! My Onyx Boox Note Max is registering random touch presses</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1m9tk6c/help_my_onyx_boox_note_max_is_registering_random/</link>
      <description>I have the latest firmware on my Onyx Boxx Note Max, but still I have a problem: the touchscreen is constantly registering random touchscreen presses at random positions on the screen. I constantly hear the touchscreen clicks and random commands are being run: it is trying to do screenshots, is turning on/off wifi, is clicking and moving the naviball. It’s crazy.

How do I fix it? Is it related maybe to air humidity (68% right now)? Yesterday it was working okay.

Here’s what I tried:

1. In settings I have configured the “long press”. 
2. In the upper-right quick menu I have disabled the “hand touch”. 
3. I have wiped the screen with soft cloth
4. I have restarted the device, twice

How to fix it?</description>

      <title>Replacement screen</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1ma103p/replacement_screen/</link>
      <description>So I have had an onyx boox poke 5 for a bit more than a year now, and a coupe of weeks ago the screen glitched out and appears to be broken; I didn’t drop it or anything so I don’t think that I am at fault, but whatever. Anyway, I contacted them, as I still had some weeks left on the warranty. They said that it didn’t apply to the warranty and then quoted me $135 to replace the screen. That is only like $25 off the price of the device itself. After some emails it seemed like they were trying to stall me out of the warranty, and they did. I am not going to support the corporate greed and ship it to them for the cost of a new device. I found out the model of the screen and have been searching for it everywhere to no avail. I can replace the screen, I just can’t find one. The screen model is ED060KC6. Any help on where I can find this screen is greatly appreciated.</description>

      <title>Which eink device for reading biology and physics research paper?</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1ma38t9/which_eink_device_for_reading_biology_and_physics/</link>
      <description>I’d like to gift my fam who’s studying biophysics in a uni a new eink device. He owns a iPad and a kindle paperwhite, but isn’t 100% satisfied with either of them. 

Cons of iPad: distractions lol
Cons of Paperwhite: the screen is too small to read a research paper. He has to convert research paper into the file format that kindle requires.

What are some of the best eink device that is suitable for his needs? I read that Scribe, Supernote, Remarkable and Boox could all be a good option for him. Ideally he could read pdf directly from the device without needing to convert the file format.</description>

      <title>有谁还记得清华腚姐，广州地铁姐、成都地铁姐，感觉与武大图书馆事件如出一辙</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1maieu7</link>
      <description>\## 清华腚姐

别人的书包碰到了此人屁股，便发朋友圈说要让此人社死

经典语录：经社会压力后声明说希望\*\*双方相互道歉\*\*后到此为止。

\## 广州地铁姐：

\&gt; [四川大学](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%9B%9B%E5%B7%9D%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6)新闻与传播学院研究生张薇在[广州地铁](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%B9%BF%E5%B7%9E%E5%9C%B0%E9%93%81)污蔑一名56岁男子“[偷拍](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%81%B7%E6%8B%8D)”她，张薇在该男子自证偷拍行为以及警方调解后，在网络发布未经[马赛克](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%A6%AC%E8%B3%BD%E5%85%8B_(%E5%BD%B1%E5%83%8F%E8%99%95%E7%90%86))处理拍摄男子容貌的視頻版本，并发表相关争论性言论

经典语录：

\&gt; **“难道我的权益没有受到侵害我就不用去维权了吗？”**

**&gt; “如果他真的没有偷拍，那为什么他没有为自己发声？”**

\## 成都地铁姐：

\&gt; 2023年6月11日，何先生乘坐的列车到达[成都地铁](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%88%90%E9%83%BD%E5%9C%B0%E9%93%81/1025483?fromModule=lemma_inlink)火车南站后，有一名女性大喊起来“你是不是在偷拍”，被指偷拍的工具，正是他脚上的那双鞋。当时，这双鞋被指发着“绿光”，像是一枚摄像头。随后，列车安全员闻声赶来，何先生被要求脱去鞋袜，随后在众目睽睽之下被架着下了列车。此后，在等待警察到来的半个多小时里，他又被要求靠墙单脚站在乘客上、下的扶梯口。后续，双方被带到派出所接受问询与调查，直到第二天凌晨。</description>

      <title>大多数国男对性别对立的理解远远落后版本</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/China_irl/comments/1ma9z6p/大多数国男对性别对立的理解远远落后版本/</link>
      <description>本人男，混迹小红书多年，经常刷到性别议题。不过我从来不发言，只是默默观看。经过几年的观察，大部分男人，对现在年轻群体中的女性主义有些严重的误解和信息滞后，还依然习惯用过去的传统思维惯性去看待。我可以说，对于00后乃至10后，女性主义是一个时尚单品和出厂配置，已经成为了一个不断扩张的意识形态，不亚于当年共产主义在中华民国的传播

从二本到985，学历水平越高的大学，尤其是文科，女性主义越遍地开花。各位可以查看一下附近大学社科学院/文学院/法学院/商学院这类女性扎堆的地方，每年发表多少篇关于性别的论文，到底是怎么写的

# 国男中的性别光谱：

国男中的大多数：好好上班攒钱，找个女人结婚生子。对女性主义和性别对立一无所知

国男中的日子人：性别对立是网上一小部分人起哄，现实哪有那么多人吵架

国男中的进步派：打拳只是没文化没钱的底层人，高学历高颜值的都不打拳的

国男中的激进派：打击极端女权

# 国男眼中的女性光谱 vs 真正的女性主义光谱

国男眼中的正常女性：好好过日子 结婚生子

&gt;这类人在女性主义者眼里 = 丧失主体性的爱男娇妻

国男眼中的女权主义者：有独立的思想  追求职业发展 不过依然受限于传统性别角色

&gt;这类人在女性主义者眼里 = 女性中的日子人 鸵鸟派

国男眼中的中等激进女权：开始有性别意识，不再服从传统性别角色。不过看待事情站在一个客观公正的角度

&gt;这类人在女性主义者眼里 = 脑子没完全觉醒的女人

国男眼中的极端女权：要高彩礼  责任义务不对等

&gt;这类人在女性主义者眼里 = 脾气不好的娇妻 本质还是依附男人 给男人生孩子

# 真正的女性主义光谱：

真正的温和女性主义者： 保护自身女性利益，拒绝性别歧视和压迫。有事就发声，想慢慢改良女性生存环境。对男人和婚姻持谨慎态度

真正的“中间派”女性主义者：不婚不育，厌男或者不沾男，生活不需要男人。抛弃社会塑造给女性的特征，我就是主体，女性就是主体，想怎么活怎么活

真正的中等激进女性主义者：通过学术论文、社媒账号、脱口秀、广告营销、政府宣传部门、司法部门这些比较有影响力的单位，传播和实践女性主义，唤醒更多人的女性意识，实现girl help girl

真正的激进女性主义者： 冲锋派，反异性恋，有男踩男，有女利女，男人就是对手。相信鲁迅的屋顶-窗户理论：要先提议把屋顶拆了，才能把窗户打开。通过激进手段（大部分是让男人吃亏/无法接受）的方式，扩大女性权利。e.g 如果司法偏袒男性，那就把一批无辜的男性从严判决。如果有针对女性的歧视词语，那就创造一批对男性的歧视词语

女性主义传播的速度远远超乎想象，光谱还会不断的向激进派移动。10年前的激进派只相当于今天的温和派，5年前的激进派只相当于现在的中间派。今年3.8节各个城市的商场大屏就出现了各种女性标语，这在以前是不可想象的。5年前杨笠调侃了下男人就受到那么多争议，而现在针对性别议题的脱口秀遍地开花，把男人塑造成全方位的丑角，尺度比杨笠激进多了。从现在视角看，杨笠的言论简直像是撒娇

遗憾的是，国男从老到小对比一无所知，即使了解的还用传统思维批判。在他们眼中，女性依然是，并且应该是可爱、温和、柔弱需要保护的，女人总是要和他们的结婚的，他们不知道这股社会运动到了什么地步，女性主义者对他们有多不满。不过他们终将会为此，在某一天迎来沉痛的一击

新鲜出炉的武大诬告案就是一个例子。女生杨某在大学就发表女性主义论文，在看到当事男图书馆抓外阴后，就诬告对方偷拍和性骚扰。具体细节在知乎有详细阐述，让人不得不佩服的是其手段熟练。从一开始的要三封手写道歉信拿到证据，再去学院举报让男生受到处分，失去保研资格。最后试图通过司法让对方坐牢退学，差一点就成功了，是男方父母及时救场。女方败诉之后就在b站开盒，这些手段目的就是从社会各方面让对方社会性死亡。目的和动机，从她的立场猜测，是想通过极端手段打击每一个潜在的骚扰犯，不管过程是怎么样的，立场＞事实，总之把男的往死里整就对了

本人只是一个屁民，生活还有一堆事要处理，只想过好这一生，没空参与政治运动。不过为了保护自己，可以在生活中做到

1. ⁠⁠⁠严查成分：对于身边女性和同事，多聊性别议题，看看什么成分再决定往来和是否合作
2. ⁠⁠⁠保持强硬： 不要展现所谓的男性大度，不要对女性有着温和柔弱的假设。面对女性不友好，保持强硬
3. ⁠⁠⁠拒绝花钱： 所有的钱都用于投资自我。给的每一份彩礼，给女人花的每一分钱，都可能滋养女性主义的土壤</description>

      <title>大罢免的结论 国会才是真民意</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/China_irl/comments/1maegc5/大罢免的结论_国会才是真民意/</link>
      <description>喜欢键政台湾而不是大陆的魅力就在于这里，所有的论述都有被实证检验（投票）的一天。虽然人在美国，但被台湾吸引眼光的地方在于，这个检验频次太高了，快感觉到年年在选举（其实2年一次），而美国太久一次

每次看到民进党及其支持者闹麻了，什么代表台湾主流民意，我都不信。因为政府通过标案拿公共的钱眷养党的媒体侧翼，已经不是什么新闻。我只看地方行政首长，国会和总统得票率。

实证精神是破除误导的核心工具。比如政党支持率我只看立法院不分区。政党实力看国会比例，九合一地方选举以及总统得票率。这是唯一可得的population。任何与这个结果偏离巨大的sample都说明存在bias。而妄图通过这种sample来得出某些代表性结论都是扯。

至于民进党及其支持者喜欢壮声势的“台湾认同是主流”就很扯，因为首先台湾人/中国人的认同民调本身不可证伪，我对民调主体的信任度挺差的，和实证结果往往偏离太多。而且在逻辑上和实证结果有偏差，比如为什么台独会支持国民党和民众党？而且这个问卷的设计上就有问题，按现状，台湾是中国的下位概念，是和大陆平行概念。在加州问“你是加州人还是美国人”想得出什么结论？我该怎么选呢？如果是想强调独立性，应该是问“你是台湾人还是中华民国人”，强调民族认同，“你是否认为台湾人不是华人”等等。</description>

      <description>即使台海议题在台湾政治议题中占比很高，从第三方视角看，也不至于可以直接用“Pro China”“China-friendly”这种词来形容蓝白政党。然而BBC卫报NPR美联社就直接写标题里，这基本上按绿营口径走。似乎对于英语媒体，必须在把台湾放在中国话题下，才是台湾新闻的报道价值，某种意义上，这也是西方视角下的台湾人民，一点主体性没有，不关心自身民主建设，不关心社会民生问题，似乎只为了中国议题而存在。</description>

      <title>和白人女生约会初体验</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/China_irl/comments/1maa1ff/和白人女生约会初体验/</link>
      <description>今晚我和一个白人女孩的第一次约会去了酒吧。里面比想象中的嘈闹，所以我们决定坐在露台上。约会本身还不错，但聊天没有我和台湾菲律宾女生那样自然流畅，中间有几次尴尬的沉默。其实我也觉得和她很难产生共鸣，她是学新闻的艺术生，也挺健谈的，但是聊的乐队艺术家我也比较难接话。另外我好像是酒吧里的唯一的非白人男性，所以感觉也不是很自在。我们聊了一个半小时，然后我开车送她回他停车的车站，各自回家。想了想这个用约会软件的这三十天约会的三个女生，我觉得以后还是只和中国人或者亚洲人约会比较好吧。

我可能已经把约会软件上附近所有亚洲女孩都滑完了，现在 Hinge 和 Bumble 只给我推白人女生。我打算不再用这些软件了，看看能不能在乒乓球俱乐部或者我去华人社区协会做义工时认识一些中国女生。

后续：她约我见下一次，我已经同意了。下一次一起去博物馆</description>

      <description>我感觉互联网上讨论留守儿童的话题不太多。想问一下，现在中国，或者说你身边留守儿童的问题严重吗？主观感受数量多还是少？</description>

      <title>Are the devs on summer vacation?</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/1maefwx/are_the_devs_on_summer_vacation/</link>
      <description>I don't think cheaters are getting banned anymore. I have played 25 games out of 60 against cheaters (blatant) and I have yet to receive some roll back. I honestly think the devs are on summer vacation right now and have few guys in the office at a time to make sure the servers are up and running so people spend money to buy cosmetics. Their summer plan is not to address cheaters, their target is to make as much money as possible for their shareholders. I know this is a rant that is heard here on a daily basis but does anyone have any insight on what is going on at ubisoft?</description>

      <link>https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1maczio</link>
      <description>Hey guys, I was wondering: What's the best way to place barbed wire? Assume site is 2F Dorms. Is it:

1. Out (facing outside of the doorway)  
2. Middle (In between doorway)  
3. In (facing inside doorway)  
4. Doesn't matter

Thanks!</description>

      <title>Wtf is “drag shooting”?</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/1mab0wv/wtf_is_drag_shooting/</link>
      <description>This guy playing Tubarao with the DMR and was full autoing it faster than an SMG or AR.

I called him out for using scripts or macros and how it’s cheating and his teammates said he’s “drag shooting” and it’s totally legal.

Lmao I don’t care what you do to make a DMR shoot faster than any AR in the game it’s fucking cheating in my book.</description>
