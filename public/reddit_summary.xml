      <title>Looking for a specific Large Water Jug for home usage as a gift.</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1mdwn3l/looking_for_a_specific_large_water_jug_for_home/</link>
      <description>I tried looking around for a water jug or bottle subreddit but came across this and wanted to ask. My step-father recently retired a gift that i had got for him, a Ozark Trail 1 Gallon Jug (i'll link a similar one below) that served him for what felt like 5+ years or so. I've been wanting to get him a new one for his upcoming birthday but with a straw or any sort of equivalent to suck the liquids from within out. 

He mostly sits at a desk all day near a pc and uses it for that, filling it up with water/ice and such so he doesnt have to get up and constantly refill it throughout the day since his desk and pc is on the other side of the house from the kitchen. His biggest complaint with the old one was that with no straw he had trouble drinking from it, since well...it's big (He asked for the gallon size). He's really wanted one with one of those popout straws or anything of the like. The size is fine, as he WANTS it that big or similar and really wants one that will keep ice cold and not have it melt. Looking for any recommendations of a good large sized jug that has a straw and keeps stuff really cold for as long as possible. I'd say bonus points if it has a handle to help him carry it into the room with his desk. 

Similar Jug to what i bought him years ago: [https://www.amazon.com/Kerilyn-Insulated-Stainless-Sweat-Proof-Outdoors/dp/B09XMWMNY2](https://www.amazon.com/Kerilyn-Insulated-Stainless-Sweat-Proof-Outdoors/dp/B09XMWMNY2)</description>

      <title>A 50+ Year Old Fridge</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1mdtiga/a_50_year_old_fridge/</link>
      <description>My Irish grandmother had a fridge that she bought the year before my youngest uncle was born. It remained in active use in her kitchen until he was in his mid-fifties.

The handle was admittedly touch and go for the last few years (it was a wooden handle that connected to some sort of hinge, almost like a car door). It was impossible to open by pulling at the side (like you can do with a normal fridge nowadays), so this was a pretty big problem. But it still kept food cold for more than five decades. 

Does this sort of quality in electronics even exist anymore? I've no idea what brand this fridge was or whether it was a top of the line model (wish I had a picture of it) but my grandmother was not an especially wealthy woman so I can't imagine she went completely all out when buying her fridge. So, a presumably mid-range fridge bought in the 1960s in Ireland could be expected to last fifty years or more.

      <description>Hello everyone,

I bought this LaCie Key USB drive for my keychain so long ago and it still works flawlessly.

Would any of you have any recs for a similar drive but USB C (or both)?

Metal frame ideally, if possible...</description>

      <description>This has probably been asked a billion times, but I want to buy a set of plates that aren't just durable, but timeless *and* are guaranteed to still be in existence 15 yrs from now when half of them are lost or broken. It has to be a line of plates that has existed forever and always will. Preferably white or minimal in design.</description>

      <title>My grandmother‚Äôs 1960s KitchenAid mixer</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1mdxum1/my_grandmothers_1960s_kitchenaid_mixer/</link>
      <description>My grandmother‚Äôs 1960s KitchenAid mixer finally died after 63 years of daily use
Posted this in honor of my grandma‚Äôs beast of a machine that finally gave up the ghost yesterday.


This thing survived:
	‚Ä¢	63 years of daily bread making
	‚Ä¢	Being dropped down basement stairs twice
	‚Ä¢	My uncle using it to mix concrete (don‚Äôt ask)
	‚Ä¢	4 moves across states
	‚Ä¢	Being inherited by 3 different family members
	‚Ä¢	Countless holiday cookie marathons


Still had the original attachments. Never needed a single repair until last week when the motor started smoking.


Took it to a repair shop and the guy said ‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, this thing doesn‚Äôt owe you anything. It‚Äôs lived 10 lifetimes.‚Äù


Ordered a new KitchenAid but honestly I doubt it‚Äôll last 5 years, let alone 60+. They don‚Äôt make them like they used to.


RIP old girl. You were the real MVP of every family gathering.


Anyone else have appliances that have been passed down through generations? What‚Äôs your longest-lasting purchase?</description>

      <title>Boox Go 6 vs. Bigme B6?</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1mdddsw/boox_go_6_vs_bigme_b6/</link>
      <description>Tragically, I've crushed the screen of my beloved Likebook P6. 

This tablet was everything I wanted: 

* 6"
* Android
* e-ink. 

But now it's time for a replacement. I'd love to find something with all those same attributes. 

I think I've narrowed it down to the Boox Go 6 and the Bigme B6. Has anyone used both devices? Any obvious winner between the two? 

  
Thank you r/eink!</description>

      <description>Hi everyone, just a PSA. I bought the new 13k (https://shop.dasung.com/products/dasung-paperlike-13k-the-worlds-first-37hz-3k-e-ink-monitor?variant=51448939086008) and it seems that it doesn't work at all on linux :(. I was hoping to be able to use it for both my Mac and my Linux computers - but alas. 

Does anyone know if there's a way to get the Windows Paperlike Client working on linux?</description>

      <description>I could really use some help. I recently started looking into E-Ink devices and I got myself overwhelmed with what's out there. I think I'll only really be using it for reading, no note taking or anything. Would have to be android based to download what I need to. I like the idea of something large to read off of, but I also like the idea of something like the palma 2 to keep in my pocket. Like I said, I've overwhelmed myself. Any help is appreciated!</description>

      <title>Bigme Hibreak Pro Review July 2025</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1mdabmf/bigme_hibreak_pro_review_july_2025/</link>
      <description>This is an update to my previous review circa March 2025. Let's get started :)

# My use case:

* Stock Bigme Launcher
* Reading in KOReader, Mihon, and Libby
* Spotify
* morning alarm clock
* playing NYTimes Games, Codenamea, and taking some notes.
* some Whatsapp
* Airline tickets and concert tickets (they have a much easier time scanning this than LED phones)
* Airplane mode 100% of the time (no SIM card), though I'll use WiFi and Bluetooth \~25% of the time.

# The good:

* Screen refresh is fantastic, clear, and plenty fast‚Äîeven better after recent software updates.
* Mihon (Tachiyomi), KOReader, and Libby work perfectly to make this one of the ultimate pocket e-readers. I switched to KoReader from Moon+Reader and couldn't be happier. It's got a simple, easy-to-navigate interface. Mapping the fingerprint reader to button46 even allow the user to open the menu just by resting their finger on the power button. KOReader hasn't had any issues with my large book library and is infinitely customizable.
* It feels great in my hand and doesn't weigh too much, though it's the biggest phone I've ever owned.
* Battery life is unchanged from when I first got the phone‚Äîabout 20%/day with heavy use (multiple hours of reading, tons of app installations/uninstallations, playing music in the car, etc). Idle it will last for 1-2weeks.
* Camera is good!
* Wifi, Bluetooth, backlight, flashlight, and fingerprint reader all work great!
* I've not made phone calls regularly with this device in the past few months so I can't speak to that performance. I will try to use it as my daily driver here for the next few weeks and will revisit this in this post.

# Current issues:

* The software seems piecemeal‚Äîvery carefully thought out in some places like the control center, but like a poorly designed bandaid solution in others: notification pulldown and settings menu.
   * Severity: 1/5
* Quick settings pulldown is shorter than the screen height, so the names of the bottom row of toggles are clipped.
   * Severity: 1/5
* Notification pulldown always pulls full instead of just the height of whatever notifications are there necessitating multiple full-screen refreshes.
   * Severity: 1/5
* Settings menu has lots of settings that are duplicates of settings found in the stock Android settings app, but not everything, so you still need to use both. So it's just clutter.
   * Severity: 1/5
* After opening the lockscreen, sometimes it won't register a fingerprint or navigation gestures and you need to put in your pin. Annoying, but doesn't break anything.
   * Severity: 2/5 - More startling than it is serious
* Automatic brightness is still not very impressive. It always seems either too bright or too dim for me. My workaround is setting the gesture for "hold left down button" to turn on/off the backlight to a preset level I like it at. It works really well :)
   * Severity: 2/5 - This is a feature I'd really like to get working well. It could bring this phone from a 9/10 to a 10/10.

^(Old issues that have been FIXED:)

* ~~^(home, back, and recent apps gestures either don't register or aren't working \~10% of the time. Never had this problem on any other phone: S22, S23, S24, Pixel 6, Pixel 7, Poco F3, Motorola Stylus.)~~
* ~~^(The left-side buttons are set to page up/down but are still functioning as volume buttons)~~
* ~~^(even with animations turned off in settings, swipes, pulling down the notification tray, and many random presses still show animations)~~
* ~~^(android auto supported as of recently)~~
* ~~^(The power button has already become finicky a mere 7 days in. It now takes 3-4 presses to get the phone to lock on the home screen)~~

# Overall:

I would recommend the Bigme Hibreak Pro to anyone who wants a superiorly capable ereader. Paired with Calibre, it's a force to be reckoned with, and the build quality seems to be holding up quite well :) I'm also impressed with how Bigme has responded to the community and quickly fixed the most egregious software issues on the device.

I look forward to testing this as my daily-driver again in the coming days (coming from an S23)

\#### Have a great day :)

      <title>Do You Use a Device for Digital Planning? If So, Which One?</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1mdjxmc/do_you_use_a_device_for_digital_planning_if_so/</link>
      <description>**Hey Redditors!**  
I stumbled across this community by accident, but wow ‚Äî I see a ton of e-ink device users here, lol. So I figured this would be a great place to ask a quick question.

We create digital planners for iPad and also custom-optimized versions for various e-ink devices ‚Äî we adjust things like aspect ratio, screen resolution, and sidebar placement so the planner interface doesn't overlap with the device‚Äôs native menus. Everything is fully customizable, with tons of features, templates, and themes. You can choose vertical or horizontal layouts, and even set up your own scheduling style.

So far, we‚Äôve made versions for:

* **reMarkable** (with both [color-themed](https://files.onplanners.com/custom/2bf1024cd52dc5e9a909f63f4e6bc18a0.pdf?filename=Ultimate-Planner-for-reMarkable-digital-vertical-Elegant-Color.pdf) and [grayscale](https://files2.onplanners.com/custom/d710b958a4a8fe85479b082007ef87620.pdf?filename=Ultimate-Planner-for-reMarkable-digital-vertical-Contrast.pdf) options)           Google [Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AvmFPSv6fKi1oLtuJ-hJJ97FVhj8dSnQ?usp=sharing)
* **Onyx Boox / Kobo** ([color](https://files.onplanners.com/custom/2b7acb6d597e9a738d051456d86397ef0.pdf?filename=ONYX-BOOX---Ultimate-Planner-digital-vertical-Elegant-Color.pdf) and [monochrome](https://files2.onplanners.com/custom/8adb0926da9ffafda13ad98875d66da50.pdf?filename=ONYX-BOOX---Ultimate-Planner-digital-vertical-Contrast.pdf) versions)                    Google [Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UxQUhqqOwmhOwmmTGNVh5ykoF5JOLC20?usp=sharing) 
* **Kindle Scribe -** [download link](https://files2.onplanners.com/custom/ac26adba11b0762446509afe11aec8850.pdf?filename=Kindle-Scribe-Ultimate-Planner-digital-Contrast.pdf)**Google** [**Drive**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZZDZ88Z6F-JSQBZYtEJWHfUccjsFa4Jh?usp=sharing)
* **Supernote -** [**download link**](https://files2.onplanners.com/custom/9e775ba7e8c86e9be3f6737045d38b590.pdf?filename=Supernote---Ultimate-Planner-digital-vertical-Contrast.pdf)**Google** [**Drive**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IcAPRmtgdQxoSQpZyTN5KYlef9Jin56i?usp=sharing)

üëâ **Please note ‚Äî I'm not here to sell anything.**  
I genuinely want to hear your feedback.

**Do you use a device for digital planning? And if so, which one?**  
We‚Äôre planning to expand the lineup and I‚Äôd love to know what other devices you use ‚Äî or if you even use digital planners at all.

If you're up for it, feel free to try one of our test planners and let me know what works, what doesn‚Äôt, and what you'd love to see added.  
I‚Äôm also including a link to my personal Google Drive folder where I share some free templates.

Thanks so much in advance! üôè</description>

      <title>A perfect daytime companion: Woxter Scriba 195 S</title>
      <link>https://i.redd.it/q1i4hhaax2gf1.jpeg</link>
      <description>A very compact and basic ereader: no internet connection, no backlight, no touchscreen.

A truly pocket ebook reader with a nice and clear 4,7" screen. Perfect when there's plenty of light. It supports landscape mode, it's very light and has physical buttons: it's the best option for long reading sessions using just one hand. Fast boot time, decent battery life and friendly price: I got mine for 40 EUR.

It's not for everyone but it has some interesting use case scenarios because it's truly a pocket ereader and really simple to use. And no spyware, cookies, ads... Just an ereader that minds its own business.

Extra bonus: you can play sokoban!

And yes, it's the same ereader as the Y-Ben P47 Pocker e-reader but rebranded and with a translated software.</description>

      <description>Be wary of good-e-reader and this man right here‚Ä¶

I was a follower of his channel for a year and chose to place an order on his site about 3 months ago not knowing that it was a drop shipping site. Total was about $440‚Ä¶ as of today I have not received the product and despite rudely and dismissively answering one support email about 2 months ago (email signature was from Peter) all subsequent support emails have been ignored.

If I would have seen this trustpilot score before hand I would have avoided this whole mess‚Ä¶ I am now left dealing with my bank to get my money back. Posting this to help save other noobs the same hassle‚Ä¶ stick to Amazon or Boox.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôm locked out of my Ubisoft account cause I don‚Äôt have access to the email it was made with. Somehow my Xbox account associated with it got unlinked. So I have no way to access it. It‚Äôs my grandmas old email she used to make the Ubisoft account when I was 12 years old (I‚Äôm 26 now). I contacted Ubisoft support and they said they can‚Äôt confirm it was my account even though I provided screenshots of me signed into the website and videos of me playing siege on it with my info visible. I‚Äôm beyond devastated. I spent so much time grinding on this game and so much money into it over the years. It‚Äôs all gone.</description>

      <description>They have to be ragebaiting at this point. I'm so tired dude. This has been going on for like 2 weeks now. I'll send the exact photo they want, and then they'll ask me to send it again. And again. And again. Then they say something like, "Is the content downloaded?"
"Yep." 
"Great! So can you send it again? And also a picture of your email, uncropped please? And then..."
I'm on the verge of losing my patience.</description>
